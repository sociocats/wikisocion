<p><a class="reference internal" href="reinin_dich.html"><span class="doc">Reinin dichotomies</span></a> or Reinin traits refer to a set of 15 type dichotomies that were mathematically justified by Grigoriy Reinin. For a table of socionics types and dichotomies see <a class="reference internal" href="reinin_dich.html#reinin-overview"><span class="std std-ref">overview of Reinin traits</span></a>. This study was conducted at Dynamic Socionics Center headed by <a class="reference internal" href="mironov.html"><span class="doc">V. Mironov</span></a>.</p>
<p>Original publication: <a class="reference external" href="http://www.dynamicsocionics.ru/napolnenie-priznakov-reynina.html">http://www.dynamicsocionics.ru/napolnenie-priznakov-reynina.html</a></p>

<h2>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Additional typological attributes, whose existence has been theoretically proven by G.R. Reinin in 1984, are an important achievement in Socionics as a science. Since the moment of their publication, there have been many attempts to describe their real world manifestations, as well as attempts to prove their absence. Among those it is possible to cite work of G. R. Reynin himself [4,5,7] and A. Augustinavichyute [2], and also V.I. Stratiyevskoy, V.V. Gulenko [3], N.L. Savitsky, E.S. Filatovoy [8], and many others. However the reasons for our research were seminars by T.N. Prokofeva in St.Petersburg, in the course of which participants became acquainted with results of her long-term work in this area.</p>
<p>The purpose of the research of the group was an attempt to reveal independent existence of each Reinin attribute, and also to check newly obtained results with results of previous experiments. Since the attribute groups are dichotomous, it was expected to obtain in each case two expressed poles that would be manifested independently from other attributes of the participants (such as Jungian functions and other Reinin attributes groups).</p>
<p>The approach used was “the method of inverse problem” (G. R. Reinin [4]) and consists of the following: the group of subjects, whose sociotypes did not cause differences in the estimation of experts, was divided into two parts in accordance with the specific attribute being estimated (observed). After that all participants in turns spoke on the assigned neutral theme: first the group that represented one pole of the Reinin group would speak, then group that represented the other, for example, first spoke Dynamics, then Statics. This way, differences in their statements, their behavior, or the absence of them came to light, as did the nature of the differences. Speech features (words used, prevalence of those or other parts of speech, the form of construction of phrases), nonverbal reactions, the specific character of the described behavior by subjects, the specific character of the observed behavior by experts, expressed and displayed positions, etc. were observed.</p>
<p>Besides the members of the work group, who also appeared in the role of experts, representatives of “missing” types were invited and were subjected to the same approach that the members of the work group were subjected to. In total the number of those participating was around 100 people with no less then 20 people for each attribute.</p>
<p>Here are the results of our study.</p>

<h3>Subjectivists<a class="headerlink" href="#subjectivists" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Subjectivists are good at noticing the general emotional background that accompanies contact with people (For example: enthusiasm, fun, stress and so on). Fun (as, probably, every other emotional experience) for them is allocated into a separate aspects of activity (to a question “what were you doing” they can answer “we were having fun”—they perceive emotional engagement as a separate type of activity)</p></li>
<li><p>Subjectivist types do not perceive “getting to know somebody” as a special kind of activity, in contrast to Serious types, for whom it is a kind of a ritual. They know very well why they are getting acquainted (the purpose of this acquaintance is interest, business, travel, and so on). In contrast to the Objectivist types, they do not divide the process of getting acquainted into consecutive stages. They immediately establish the necessary emotional distance in contact and can regulate it as needed. To bridge the gap between poorly acquainted people in a group they amp up the emotional tone—this can be mutually experienced happiness or misfortune. The “name” of the person is of secondary relevance for them. Interest towards the person and relations is primary here, thus Merry types do not consider formality as a necessary part of becoming acquainted with someone.</p></li>
<li><p>The Subjectivist, in contrast to the Objectivist, is not inclined to derive “objectively accurate” rules and regularities, generalizing for this purpose his own experiences and experiences of others. Instead, the Subjectivist assumes that other people have different criteria and their own views on any situation, therefore he determines whether his or someone else’s actions were correct or incorrect by comparing them with his “subjective” view—he evaluates them in accordance to his personal concepts, “his system”, his intentions, and so on. Subjectivist are inclined to propose (or impose) not the “correct way” or another way to do things, but an entire conceptual framework on the subject i.e. they do not say “Do this differently” but rather “Look at it in another way”. They do not think, in contrast to Objectivists, that in every situation there exists only one “objectively correct/true” way of doing something—in their opinion, there are many different ways of looking at and approaching a given situation. When they feel something was done incorrectly, they will likely ask: “What are you doing?” (In contrast to Objectivists who are likely to ask “Who does it this way?”). When they speak of optimality, they mean optimality within the framework of their idea or concept, within the framework of their subjective approach (from which point of view is it most optimal and in comparison to what). Therefore they strive to contrast other people’s views to their own and to explain their position (to verify concepts): “If this is what is meant, we do this, if something else is meant, we do it differently.”</p></li>
<li><p>“Comparison and verification of concepts” is a common phenomenon among Subjectivists. It concerns not only their methods, but also their understanding, terminology, and so on. Subjectivists are attuned to the fact that different people might understand and interpret different concepts and terms differently. They perceive terminology as well as actions of other people as a part of the subjective concept inseparable from personal opinion, position, intent, etc.: “So we have agreed that we shall call it this way”. In contrast to Objectivists who perceive terminology as “objective”, Subjectivists understand personal differences behind terminilogy (this applies even to well established terms) and they attempt to compare and verify them (“Well you say this, but I think it’s not so, but so-and-so”).</p></li>
<li><p>Lexicon: when discussing actions and joint activities they use expressions such as “From my point of view”, “According to my understanding”, “To my knowledge”, “personal criteria”, “it corresponds to my understanding” “I have concluded” “he insisted” and so on. They describe verbal communication in detail—how their intervention in the situation is transpiring or why it’s not happening.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="objectivists">
<h3>Objectivists<a class="headerlink" href="#objectivists" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Serious types poorly recognize common emotional background; they do not perceive emotionally infused conceptions (for example “fun”) as separate and substitute them with interpretations that have no direct emotional elements. (Instead of the word “fun” they may use “entertainment”, “leisure”, “pleasure”, and so on). They do not perceive emotional exchange as a separate occurrence and are inclined to mix it with other mutual matters (They can have fun while working, or engage in serious affairs while having fun.)</p></li>
<li><p>For Serious types, becoming acquainted with a new person constitutes a special ritual necessary for bridging the distance (If this ritual did not take place, then Serious types do not consider themselves to be acquainted, for example: “We did not introduce ourselves”). In such situations, for the Serious types it is easier if the degree of emotional distance was externally predetermined i.e. if it was set by some sort of “mediator”, whether this be a person or circumstances of a given situation—this allows them to skip the first stages of becoming acquainted and move on to a closer dialogue and contact. For bridging the distance between strangers, Serious types create certain rules or rituals (or they use already existing ones) for the step-by-step association. They know the process of becoming acquainted very well (how a stranger becomes a familiar). For association, Serious type needs to know the name, title, any other information that describes the new person—therefore formal introduction for them is a very important stage of getting acquainted with someone.</p></li>
<li><p>Objectivists have a notion of what constitutes “objectively known” facts, rules, laws, regularities held in general (common) experience; in their perception there exist rules and guidelines that are “true in general” and “always correct”. They suppose that other people can have their own views and positions, but do not consider that any action can be viewed as correct/incorrect only from a certain point of view (they allow for the existence of “objectively correct” actions). Therefore, from the point of view of an Objectivist, actions can be different—subjective, determined by personal preferences and motives, and objective, where there is only one “correct”, “most effective” way to do something. Objectivists define actions as correct or incorrect contrasting them to their representation of what is “objectively correct”. When they think that there is only one optimal solution, they are inclined to propose (or impose) ways to accomplish an activity (not their views or concepts like Subjectivists) which they think are the best: “No, do it the right way”. When speaking of optimality, they speak of optimality in general—“objective optimality” (they consider that they know the “correct”, “generally optimal” ways of doing something). In joint activities they offer the “most effective” way of doing something. In disagreement they do not compare and verify concepts, but instead check whether the other person knows the “correct”, “generally accepted”, “established” concepts and terms.</p></li>
<li><p>In contrast to Subjectivists, Objectivists are not inclined to compare and verify concepts. They assume that these can have only one unique interpretation (“correct”, “accurate” one)—often they do not think about the fact that the other person may be interpreting them differently, within a different conceptual framework. They operate with concepts such as “objective reality”, “unequivocal facts”, and do not attempt to verify concepts: “This is called with this term”. They consider that they know the “right” way of doing things, how something “really is” (they acknowledge only a certain picture of the world, one that is “objectively true”): “You say it’s like this, while in reality is like that”.</p></li>
<li><p>In description of actions or in discussion of joint activities instead of “explanatory” lexicon they give a lot of examples (all “correct” and “incorrect” modes of actions are depicted in these examples).</p></li>

<h3>Notes<a class="headerlink" href="#notes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>In this research, the hypothesis about the quadra related nature of entertainment has been show to be untrue. Also proven to be untrue was the widespread conviction that people of Serious types will not publicly display and behave in a “childish” manner. Probably in the majority of such cases (for example when adult people roll themselves down a snow hill), the situation serves as an intermediary and relaxes the existing interpersonal boundaries.</p>

<h3>Examples<a class="headerlink" href="#examples" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p><strong>Merry/Subjectivists</strong>: “Fun is a lot of emotion… company of friends, where we can exchange news, possibly go have something to eat, sing a song” “Fun is getting involved, when you actively participate. When you watch or read something, this is educational, but fun is an active state of constant excitement, something one cannot confuse with leisure (restful state)… perhaps fun for me is an animated dialogue that (as opposed to a fight, quarrel, etc.) is pleasant” “Reading books, opera - this is not fun… fun is heightened vitality” “Fun is a state of liberation when everyone is not being very serious” “Fun is pleasure, recklessness, everyone participates, some boundaries may get crossed” “If I’m in a company of new people and nobody introduces me, for me it is not a problem to introduce myself” “The majority of people with whom I chat, I may not know their full name” “The process of coming into contact can consist of any steps, becoming acquainted is not necessary” “For me, in company, the names of others are not important” “I remembered what his name was only after a week, even though we had already passionately kissed (about meeting her future husband)” “When I see that someone doing something wrong, I first have to check if that is any of my business. If it concerns me, then my first reaction is to step back and let him have enough… I have my own criteria for how things should be. Other people may have their own criteria” “First, put down the axe, then explain why you are doing that” “I assumed that I have said all that was relevant to the given theme/topic”</p>
<p><strong>Serious/Objectivists</strong>: “It is difficult for me to distinguish work activities apart from fun. Fun is difficult to define …” “I approach everything seriously, even rest” “It is always possible to find something entertaining/zany in the serious, and vice versa” “Studying should be fun. Work without an entertaining element is impossible” “What constitutes “fun” to me is not clear, what is leisure - that is clear, what is entertainment - that is also clear” “It is important that I get introduced when I’m in company of people I never met before, or better yet, that they have been told a little about myself” “I engage another person on conditions that he/she has proposed, I do not engage the person if I do not know whether the contact will be “pleasant” for him/her” “I do not like it when other people “thrust” themselves upon me or when it is done to others, for example, if suddenly my aunt whom I’m seeing for the first time starts calling me “honey” or use some other endearing expression” “The name is important. If a person does not state their name, it often means that they do not want to have a conversation” “If it is done the wrong way? Oy! It is easier for me to grab it and do it myself than to waste my time explaining. In my opinion there is only one way to “hammer a nail”” “There are things with which it is clear that some methods are futile/fruitless and that there are more effective ways of doing it. It’s very irritating when a person consistently fails to see this and keeps choosing inappropriate methods” “When I see something performed ineffectively it makes my stomach churn” “It is painful for me to see something that contradicts common sense and I can do nothing about it. If I can interfere with the situation, I will do so regardless of whether or not it concerns me” “The methods habitual to the person within the framework of his/her experience are not the same thing as objective method of doing things (this is evident by the results)”.</p>

<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Judicious types are relaxed in their natural state; they mobilize and concentrate only when needing to accomplish some objective. After the task has been completed, they demobilize again. This state of demobilization is the natural state of the Judicious types.</p></li>
<li><p>For Judicious types, it is mandatory that before they engage in some important task, they spend some time in this natural state of “slackness” (relax and distract themselves)—the better they rest, the better they will subsequently mobilize and concentrate at the crucial moments, and the better their overall performance will be. The more difficult the task ahead of them—the more crucial and necessary prior rest becomes.</p></li>
<li><p>A transition from a state of mobilization (high activity) to a state of slackness (low activity) for Judicious types does not present a problem. However, they can experience difficulties while trying to “mobilize” themselves (it is difficult for them to leave their natural state). Because of this, they often require some kind of stimulus to get mobilized (they are inclined to put themselves in situations where external factors either force them to act or someone else acts for them)</p></li>

<li><p>Judicious types are better aware of the preparatory stage and consider it more valuable (this is the stage of discussion, presenting options, choosing between them, and so on).

<li><p>Decisive types will often mobilize before it is really necessary, as if they are subconsciously preparing for accomplishing upcoming tasks; after accomplishing a task Decisive types remain in a state of mobilization for some time afterwards.

<li><p>It is necessary for Decisive types to stay in their natural sate of mobilization up until the end of an important task—the more effective the mobilization, the more fulfilling their rest will be (“If you don’t go to work—you cannot rest”)</p></li>
<li><p>After completing the necessary task, Decisive types have trouble leaving their state of mobilization (frequently this is expressed by aimless, thoughtless activity).

<li><p>Decisive types are not inclined to divide upcoming large tasks into separate stages.

While the task is still unfinished, they maintain a state of internal readiness.</p></li>

<h3>Notes<a class="headerlink" href="#id1" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The radical difference between Judicious and Decisive types is in the development of the cycle “mobilization—activity—relaxation” while performing any difficult, critical task. The concept of “natural state” does not refer to the whole process of existence of an individual—it refers only to a certain point in that cycle. The natural state of Judicious types is relaxation, slackness; the natural state of Decisive types is readiness, mobilization. Both types can distinguish between these states through contrast and clearly differentiate between them. They consciously leave their natural “base” state and “by force” bring themselves into the required state—Judicious types become aware of their state of mobilization, while Decisive types become aware of their state of rest.</p>

<h3>Hypotheses<a class="headerlink" href="#id2" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>For the Decisive sensing types, mobilization has something to do with sensing—it is something physiological, a corporal condition (mobilization for them is perceived as bodily tension). Decisive intuitive types experience (and accordingly describe) a condition of mobilization that likened to internal readiness or inspiration. In a similar fashion, relaxation for Judicious sensing types is a physical sensation/condition—an absence of pressure and stress on the body. Judicious intuitive types primarily feel this certain rhythm, of alternation of opposite states. In other words, relaxation or slackness can be perceived as divergence of attention, while mobilization as focus, as convergence of attention.</p></li>
<li><p>Decisive types view decisions they undertook as their own, and circumstances as surrounding factors in making their choice. Judicious frequently view their decisions as something they were compelled or forced to undertake by the circumstances.</p></li>
<li><p>Judicious types better than Decisive can distribute their energy and estimate their reserves and expenditures, while Decisive types can maintain a high level of “charge” for prolonged periods of time.</p></li>
<li><p>Decisive types prefer following a “campaign” method in work—when it’s required (for example, for a large reward) work intensively for days and weeks, but then have time for rest and leisure. For the Judicious types “campaign” method of work is unnatural, they prefer to carry out work in “small portions”.</p></li>
<li><p>Extrovert-introvert orientation strengthens the manifestation of this dichotomy: extroversion strengthens Decisiveness and introversion strengthens Judiciousness.</p></li>

I spend my evening as usual and why interfere with that?” “If I’m very tired—I just rest however much is necessary” “You should not work long on one problem, postpone it for another time” “Dealing with the moment of making a decision is complicated. It is not kept track of. The stage of preparation and the act of deciding occurs automatically, what happens afterwards is not related to it. Deciding is in itself an action—one can always return to it” “Thinking things over—this is the real work, after which the act of making the decision itself is not given attention. If it is necessary to do something else… I can feel in the back of my mind the circumstances that will force me to do it. I put myself into such situations” “There is a primary selection: is this necessary or not necessary, and from there things develop. The decision is somehow made, but in unconscious manner, and even if it is accepted, that does not mean that I will get around to it.” “Consideration is very nice—you still don’t need to decide. It’s even better if you don’t have to anything afterwards.” “Before deciding on something, discussions are plentiful, but which decisions are undertaken I cannot keep a track of.” “I modeled it in several versions—it is as if virtually I have already done it” “When some task is assigned, I carefully consider it for a long time. There isn’t a conclusive moment for me when I finally decide to do something” “The main thing in work is freedom of organization, freedom of choice” “The opportunity to recharge is very important, I don’t want to burn out” “I need a comfortable workplace which would be solely mine.”</p>
<p><strong>Decisive</strong>: “First, lets make a push and do it—then we shall rest” “I feel terribly frustrated when someone tries to distract or engage me before an exam. Why? It messes with my concentration, to put it another way, it messes with my “inspiration”” “Sometimes I get so tired that I can’t even sleep from the exhaustion.” “I was writing my diploma for there days straight, then I came home and just collapsed.” “Making a decision constitutes a separate moment, any doubts and fluctuations take place before that.” “I always keep track of what decision I make. Every time I make a decision it’s like a burden of responsibilities falls on my shoulders.” “I will not get stuck on the process of discussion and consideration… it will be concluded with a decision.” “If I decided watch a movie, then I will watch it” “Naturally, I remember when I made that choice” “When a person speaks of something, I perceive it as a signal to action even if it was just a suggestion… The decision to act is just an intermediate stage. If a decision is made, it does not mean that something has been done” “I don’t understand—have we decided on something or not?” “Work should be interesting, but payment—that is of course considered.” “I work for the money, I don’t consider leisure a part of it. I work as much as they pay me.”</p>

<h3>Notes<a class="headerlink" href="#id4" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>We can draw an analogy to grammatical construction of sentences. The difference between Static and Dynamic speech is analogous to the difference between different kinds of verbs in Russian: Static’s speech corresponds to verbs of perfect (certain past) kind (“I have made”), and Dynamic’s speech to verbs of imperfect (not certain past) kind (“I did”). In English language Static speech corresponds to simple (Indefinite) tenses and Dynamic to long (Continuous) tenses. It is possible to draw another more technical analogy: modern digital cameras can save their contents in two different ways: they can either save them as segments or record a digital video. In a similar way the surrounding reality is fixed in the human mind: Statics “record” reality as separate packets (“photographs”), Dynamics—as a continuous “video”.</p>

<h2>Process | Result<a class="headerlink" href="#process-result" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>As a result of “renaming” of this dichotomy by V. Gulenko, confusion arose. In A. Augustinavichjute [2] and G. Reinin [5] this dichotomy is called “left - right” (Leftists types are ILE, SEI, EIE, LSI, SEE, ILI, LSE and EII; Rightists types are ESE, LII, SLE, IEI, LIE, ESI, IEE and SLI). We utilized in this article the more contemporary “opposite” designations of V. Gulenko and T. Prokofieva (Leftists/Result types are ESE, LII, SLE, IEI, LIE, ESI, IEE and SLI, Rightists/Process types are - ILE, SEI, EIE, LSI, SEE, ILI, LSE and EII). As the names of the attributes do not determine the attributes themselves, the changing of the names is an insignificant detail, but still mentioned in case one encounters different classifications.</p>

<h3>Result<a class="headerlink" href="#result" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Result types place themselves “outside of a process”, they dissociate from it. For them the situation, the process (what they are doing) is something external to themselves, managed from aside. Because of this, Result types can deal with multiple tasks/affairs simultaneously, tracing the beginning and end of each (it is easier for them to oversee several processes at one time).</p></li>
<li><p>Result types are inclined to make intermediate and final estimates, to sum up the results or outputs. They are oriented towards the result i.e. the finishing point of a process. They experience discomfort if the matter in which they are involved does not have a clearly delineated result. This happens because these types put themselves outside of a process, thus they poorly monitor its progression—they use intermediate and final “result” estimates to track the natural flow of the process.</p></li>

<li><p>The basic difference between Process and Result types lies in their approach towards a situation or a process correspondingly from “within” and “without”, while orientation towards “process” or “result” is a secondary aspect of this. For the Result types, making estimations (the summing up of the process) is a tool they are forced to use in order to feel the flow of the process. The Process types, on the other hand, can “hang on” to a process because they do not wish to “switch off” and lose contact before its completion when some outcome is achieved.</p></li>

It is possible that Process types have have a greater level of stability and concentration of attention (ability to focus on a single topic for prolonged period of time, even in presence of distractions).

<p><strong>Left/result</strong>: “The matter at hand must be known.

<li><p>Positivists are oriented at what any situation or contact with people can potentially bring to them rather than what they could potentially lose (for example, moving is viewed as an opportunity to gain new acquaintances, friends, rather than primarily from point of view of losing existing friends).

<li><p>Positives are better at assimilating affirmative experiences. They are inclined to “convert” negative experiences into positive ones (they try to find the “silver lining”).</p></li>

<li><p>In speech of Positivists, one can detect mostly affirmative constructions and intonations.

<li><p>Negativists orient at what they could potentially lose as a result of a certain situation or contact with other people, rather than what this situation or contact can bring to them (for example, moving for negativists primarily means losing friends).

<li><p>Negativists are more inclined to speak about negative moments.

<li><p>In speech of negativists there is frequent use of negating expressions (negative pronouns, adverbs, “not” “cannot” “nobody” “never”).

<h3>Notes<a class="headerlink" href="#id9" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Previous research on this dichotomy was reduced to measuring positive/negative in the “everyday” sense of the word. In our opinion, these attitudes are a consequence of a deeper mechanism: one group perceives and describes something by denoting associated properties (Positivists) while the other group denotes properties that are not associated with it. Positivists describe a subject, individual, phenomenon, attempting to describe it through characteristics inherent in the object, while Negativists focus on properties that do not pertain to the object. The cursory impression of optimism/pessimism being the distinguishing feature of this dichotomy occurs because of this. In reality, both Positivists and Negativists possess these two attitudes and talk equally of “good” and “bad” things. The difference is in the form of presentation—for example, on the same topic of shortcomings: “I cannot say that you have no shortcomings” (negativism) and “You have several shortcomings” (positivism).</p>

<div class="section" id="id10">
<h3>Hypotheses<a class="headerlink" href="#id10" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The difference in assimilating experiences between Positivists and Negativists arises because Positivists better remember events when they did transpire, rather than events that did not occur, while Negativists are better at remembering events that did not occur, that were absent or lacking (for the Negativist, this absence constitutes an event in itself, they remember this better and draw conclusions).</p>

<li><p>Askers, to a large degree, conduct communication in a form of a question and an answer.

<li><p>The asker quickly and at once reacts to a question set in the path of it’s monologue (Independent of importance and rationality/irrationality of the question asked) ? answers the question then continues where they left off.

<h3>Notes<a class="headerlink" href="#id14" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The key element in understanding this group is the dichotomy of “goal/purpose—method/pathway”. The consciousness of the Strategist is to a larger degree orientated towards the goal/purpose itself and not towards the actions undertaken in process of achieving it, while the consciousness of the Tactician is largely focused on the path i.e. the actual actions (“steps”) but not their end goal. This encompasses not only the conscious activities of individuals, which decisions they undertake, and so on, but also external circumstances, background events, and other concurrent factors. On a general level it is possible to speak about a difference in “reference points”: either the course is corrected in accordance to some fixed goal (Strategist) or the course becomes fixed and goals become variable (Tactician).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id15">
<h3>Hypotheses<a class="headerlink" href="#id15" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Tactical types feel disappointment upon reaching a goal in cases when they had to deviate from their course. This is because the course or pathway is more important for Tactical types than their goal. Thus, in situations when their purpose came to the foreground before their course, they experienced discomfort. This is further aggravated for Rational Tacticals, who, by their nature, are inclined to plan their actions, and feel great discomfort if their plans come apart. On the other hand, a feeling of emptiness arises because when a goal has been reached the course is interrupted. Tactical types feel as if the ground temporarily leaves from under their feet. The sensation of confidence, resoluteness that accompanies their normal mode of life disappears. When they were “moving along their own path”, everything was clear and easy. Upon reaching a goal, even if it was a much desired one, Tactical types lose their “string” and often do not know how to proceed further and what to do next.</p>

Such a thing does not exit for me” “There are multiple goals at the end of each path that you take. I try to “catch” them along the way” “My way, for a long time, was clear to me” “There are many things that I could have done, but haven’t” “There are many ways in which my life could have unfolded. I could have lived in different places, could have had other professions” “If I was another person, everything could have been different” “When I look back and think about the things that could have been, I see many crossroads. I see myself, as I am living after taking a different turn—in another universe”</p>
<p><strong>Strategists</strong>: “The point is not whether the goal is big or small, but in being aware of it. The goal is clear, the course is undefined… I don’t always remember how I accomplish what I have in mind” “I was a slave to my goal” “A goal constitutes the central point of self-organization. I feel ashamed that some goals are left unfulfilled, even if they are insignificant… if a goal was drawn you can’t really erase it” “A global goal is a comforting thought.

The important thing was how they shortened or prolonged my movement towards the end point” “I keep track of “key moments” and can list them one by one. I regret that because of lack of experience I could not solve some problems effectively, and because of this it took longer time for me to reach my goal… One way or another, I would have reached the result that I wanted to reach.”</p>

For the Yielding types, this space is occupied by their resources, while for the Obstinate types—by their interests.

<h3>Influence of this attribute on determination of the type of personality:<a class="headerlink" href="#influence-of-this-attribute-on-determination-of-the-type-of-personality" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Hierarchy and status are frequently described as inherent to structural logic (Ti). According to our observations this is entirely false. White logic (Ti) types of the first quadra will adhere to formal requirements, but will not begin to reconstruct all of their behavior in accordance to a new status. In this manner will act the aristocrats of the second quadra, most obviously the sensing logical types. Some confusion can arise due to this. If we were to observe, we would see that other aristocratic types are no less inclined to such “status games”, for example “I demand that they relate to me as the director” (EIE), “I cannot associate with those of a higher position then me” (IEE).</p></li>
<li><p>Division of people into “mine” and “not mine” is frequently attributed to aristocracy. In actuality, this division holds true for any white ethics (Fi) type, including the democrats (SEE, and in particular ESI). If we expand this concept, then “my” is any person with whom close relations have been formed, there is a familiar connection or sincere attachment. For the IEE an EII sincere attachment and belonging to a group are combined: “mine” and “not mine” for them are members of “their group” or “foreign group”.</p></li>
<li><p>Switching from “you” to “formal you” [Russian language and a few other languages have formal and informal forms of reference] is not always significant from the point of view of manifestation of this attribute. According to the standards of etiquette and rules of behavior, it is accepted to address older people and those in senior position with formal form of “you” (with respect), and different informal situations, regardless of the rules, require switch to informal “you”. For instance if a child’s mother is the teacher in his class, then the child will refer to her with formal “you” in class. It is possible to give more example of this. The important thing is not how they are addressed, but the reason for doing so.</p></li>

First: to what social and economic stratus the person belongs to. Second: is he a professional or not, the way he conducts himself, his individual qualities” “I am referring to you as to a typical representative of translators” “At my workplace they hired a new secretary recently, and she works poorly, and in general is not that kind of a person. May be because she is from the suburbs… please don’t misunderstand me, I’m not an aristocrat! I’m not!” “For me this religion means nothing, but for the ordinary people it is necessary” “You are my friend, but my friends don’t steal toilet paper from McDonalds!”</p>
<p><strong>Investigation of Quadra Attributes</strong>: The concept of a “quadra spirit” or “quara values” can be expressed through the filling of three quadra attributes. Thus, for example, a song from 1930: “We shall sing and laugh alike children, in persistent struggle and labor”—was composed by a person belonging to the second quadra, not because of the “quadra spirit”, but because two attributes are embedded within it—subjectivism and decisiveness—the combination of which exists only in the second quadra.</p>

<h2>Summary<a class="headerlink" href="#summary" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The results of this research have indicated a stable tendency for existence of independent Reinin attributes and exact distribution of types by dichotomous criteria. The understanding of some attributes in socionics has been substantially improved, augmented and expanded. A few hypotheses regarding some of the attributes have not found confirmation in this experiment.</p>
<p>As was shown, similar kind of research can help with creation of objective criteria and reliable methods and tools for determining the socionics type of a personality. Furthermore, only by accounting for Reinin attributes it is possible to move towards the creation a complete, multidimensional model of psyche.</p>
<p>The experiment carried out was a pilot experiment, it’s methods and conclusion should be statistically confirmed on a large scale experimental group. Nevertheless, already it is already possible to speak of stable tendencies—in majority of cases there were practically no exceptions, for some attributes a minimal number of exceptions (approximately one person from ten) were observed. Almost all of those exceptions were connected to conscious behavioral level or acquired through education and upbringing. In manifestation of attributes on a lexic level, in speech and nonverbal communication, there were no exceptions found. For an experienced diagnostician in Socionics, it is possible to trace the manifestation of the majority of these attributes during a Socionics interview.</p>
