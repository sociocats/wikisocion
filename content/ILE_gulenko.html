<h1>ILE Profile by Gulenko<a class="headerlink" href="#ile-profile-by-gulenko" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<div class="section" id="general-description">
<h2>General description<a class="headerlink" href="#general-description" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>

<p>ILE is rather scattered and inattentive - often loses small items. May spend a lot of time thinking to himself and looking for regularities in phenomena. His logic seems paradoxical to others. He is not afraid to go against conventional opinions, if he considers them outdated. Tries to make major breakthroughs and discoveries.</p>
<p>He is yielding in matters of everyday life and needs. Will actively resist any attempts to subordinate himself to routine or a strict schedule. Despite the fact that he is busy looking for alternatives to conventional mundane life, in difficult situations he often shows impressive ingenuity and hastiness. He cannot be reasoned with with the language of force.</p>

Strives to collect all discoveries and innovations on a problem or question that is of interest to him. Persistent and expansive in dissemination of his own developments. To “light up” with an idea he needs to make it “his own”. Generates bold, alternative ideas on any topic he is faced with. If the business or work that he has to occupy himself don’t interest him, will give it a completely new turn. Can offer many applications for an invention or discovery. Poorly tolerates routine and shackles of tradition.</p>
<p>Seeks to explore and explain complex topics or phenomena for which there aren’t yet any definitive concepts or logical theories. Compares different systems to each other. Clarifies relationships between different schemes or structures. It’s important for him to find causal relationships between specific aspects and the overall general scheme.

<p>By nature he is not aggressive, but will actively defend his way of life and his ideas. Boisterously reacts to any attempts to subordinate him to unreasonable, in his view, limitations or rules. If volitional pressure is exerted on him, he immediately goes on a brief, but very strong counter-attack. While at this, he grows so excited that for a period of time loses control over his own actions. Although he can respond to a challenge, he doesn’t endure prolonged confrontation, because he cannot keep himself in a mobilized state for a long time. Therefore, he avoids direct confrontations.</p>

Inclined to discuss particularities of people’s behavior or lifestyle.</p>
<p>Often uncertain in assessing physical qualities of objects. May stare with a studying gaze, try to touch, to smell. To get a sense of taste of food or beverages needs to try out a considerable portion. Easily spends not concerning with saving or stocking up. Places his own convenience in the first place. Doesn’t give any attention to organization and order around himself. Leaves things where he has last used them, then spends much time looking for them. Interested in topics of health and sickness.

Always ready for an active exchange of opinions and views, interesting debates and arguments. To emotion responds with emotion, thus it’s important not to overdo it with the degree of engagement, else in a gust of inspiration he will forget the starting point of disagreement. If he’s in an emotionally excited state, he talks rapidly and chaotically. His thoughts begin to overtake their expression in words, and from this his speech becomes unintelligible. Occasionally has sharp changes of mood. Noise, humor, activity, cheerfulness alternate with depression and uncommunicability.</p>
<p>Constantly tracks the amount of available time. Hurries others, but disposes of his own time and the time of other people as he sees it fit. Not seldom runs late or forgets his promises to do something by an agreed deadline. At times he is fussing around, and other times acting with emphasized leisureliness.

</div>
<div class="section" id="manner-of-communication">
<h2>Manner of communication<a class="headerlink" href="#manner-of-communication" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The ILE cannot keep the right distance in communication for long; first, he is friendly with a person, then, conversely, he is hostile and demonstrates a poor relation. He is undiscerning in people’s attitudes towards himself, thus often makes mistakes in striking up friendships, acquaintances, and romantic ties. In interaction often behaves unceremoniously, may tactlessly intervene in a conversation, likes staring with a studying gaze while not considering other people’s reactions. Rarely admits his own guilt. Even if he formally apologizes continues to behave as he did before. Puts forward far-going but often unrealistic within the circumstances plans. After a while forgets about them, then offers completely different, not logically related to the previous suggestions plans that are no less grand. Dismissive towards past achievements. Interested in and likes to talk about anything extraordinary and unusual from any fields of interest. Attracted to all the newest far-reaching theories: psychics, yoga, aura - everything that cannot be explained in terms of logic and common sense. Cannot explain his ideas logically, for they are always intuitive and vague in nature. Most people cannot understand them, they either believe or don’t believe in them. Likes giving advice on how to get out of a difficult situation; with this often offers radical solutions.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="features-of-behavior">
<h2>Features of behavior<a class="headerlink" href="#features-of-behavior" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The main defining feature of ILE’s behavior with which one can confidence identify belonging to this sociotype - is significant scatterdness. The ILE is inclined to leave things where he/she has previously used them. Often loses small objects (such as keys). At his workplace and in his personal belongings there is often somewhat of a mess. Forgets what has already been done and what remains to be done. Despite this, can show the necessary resourcefulness and ingenuity in everyday affairs, drawing from everything even a smallest benefit or favor. This activity in spirit of recombination is similar to the character of Ostap Bender, due to which some may consider him to be clever and elusive. This quality is much less pronounced in the intuitive subtype. He cannot do many things at once at a fast pace, and delays carrying out uninteresting work to the last moment. Finding himself in situations where there isn’t enough time to think through all the steps inspires and activates him: all the work and chores that have accumulates he does in a short period of time, through the quality of work suffers through this.</p>
<p>Another characteristics feature of ILE’s behavior: mobilization in extreme situations. If someone exerts volitional pressure on him, the ILE immediately switches to a counter-attack; with this, his response might be stronger. Things may even progress to use of physical force in such situations. Another characteristic of this sociotype: introduction to any case, activity, or business that he’s involved in, an element of irrationality, disorder, chaos, negation. This is most clearly seen in cases of already firmly formed groups with strict discipline. This, for him, happens creatively: by destroying - he creates. Around him start to gather supporters of his far-reaching intuitive ideas. In extreme cases, this may manifest as a real “attack on windmills” - a kind of open challenge without any real chances for a change.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="appearance">
<h2>Appearance<a class="headerlink" href="#appearance" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>From outward signs of ILE, the ones that first draw attention are his figure and vertical posture. Frequently ILE’s figure is long and thin; parts of the body are also elongated, which is particularly evident in the length of legs and fingers. However, if the type has accentuated logical component, then this is not as expressed. ILE’s posture is often somewhat hunched, with a forward curvature in the upper body in the manner of the Latin letter “S”; the head, however, does not seem tilted forward. Often, the ILE has a protruding or elongated nose that draws attention. Sometimes it gives the impression that he is trying to smell something out. During conversation, the ILE likes to twirl something in his hands, for example, a pen or pencil, and often breaks it. When he is walking or enthusiastically talking about something, he gesticulates and waves his hands around as if a windmill. If this type has accentuated intuitive component, then the external features are somewhat different. Intuitive ILE has a receding chin that gently merges into neck, smaller nose, as well as a protruding upper jaw. The intuitive subtype is also not as quick in movements as the logical subtype. ILE’s eyes often seem blurry, as if they are looking through a mist or haze, poorly recognizing what’s happening around. This look seems cold, lacking in emotion or passion. Regarding clothing should be said that due to particularities of ILE’s figure, clothes on this person almost always doesn’t sit well: it sags, slips, loses buttons, etc. This is more prominent with more accentuated intuitive component.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="as-a-subordinate">
<h2>As a subordinate<a class="headerlink" href="#as-a-subordinate" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>Strengths</strong></p>
<p>Well-developed learning-oriented thinking. Erudite, inquisitive, reads a lot and remembers it. Has developed intuition, that helps him to make the right decision. Sees well the prospects of ideas and activities. May find an unexpected solution to a problem where others couldn’t see it, based on analysis of a large amount of diverse information and its consideration as if from an external point of view, intuitively. Willingly gives advice on how to get out of difficult situations. Can process vague ideas into a theory with forms of a system. Structuralist and classifier. Can be quite insistent and stubborn. Often has good organizational skills in the areas of principally novel approaches. Part places work above family and personal relations. Democratic, dislikes deference before rank.</p>
<p><strong>Problem areas</strong></p>
<p>Poorly tolerates strict regulation and routine work. Can’t live according to a strict schedule. Is rather disorganized: getting distraction by interesting details sometimes doesn’t have enough time to do the main assignment by the deadline. Can talk besides the subject matter, depart into his own thoughts. Has difficulty maintaining organization and order in his work and at his workplace. Can allow for errors in maintaining documentation. Doesn’t always take care of his appearance. Sometimes is naive and too trusting. Due to his enterprising spirit, on the one hand, and the inability to compromise - on the other, has difficulty establishing conflict-free relations with other people. At times he is stubborn, unyielding, even aggressive, especially when he is being pressured. Can with aplomb try to prove his own correctness if he is convinced of it.</p>
<p>From him one cannot demand and expect:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Practicality of inceptions and ideas;</p></li>
<li><p>Punctuality and diligence;</p></li>
<li><p>Consistency and completeness;</p></li>
<li><p>Constant order at home and in the workplace;</p></li>
<li><p>Quality in carrying out routine work;</p></li>
<li><p>Ability to smoothly adapt to the conversation partner.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Recommended occupations: If possible, it is best to give the ILE a free and flexible work schedule. It is desirable that the work is interesting to him and provides him with diversified experiences. An activity in which he is independent of others, self-sufficient, would be optimal for him. The ILE enjoys working with large volumes of diverse (preferably interesting for him) information. The best application of his interest is in the research and innovation fields. He can carry out theoretical development in areas that are strategic - that entail fundamental changes. In general, this is a mobile, dynamic person who likes changes in impressions and experiences, thus he would be happy to carry out mobile work, travel, go on business trips.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="as-a-supervisor">
<h2>As a supervisor<a class="headerlink" href="#as-a-supervisor" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Representative of this sociotype is able to grasp the general overview of events of his life, not losing broadness of perspective and not getting lost in small details. This person has a clear idea of ​​the likely direction of events and isn’t disconcerted if problems come up. Can break off from tradition as he feels a need for change. Has a lighthearted approach to ideas and prefers innovative solutions.</p>
<p>Supervisor-creator</p>
<p>He is able to earn respect of his colleagues by originality of his thinking and ability to see something new, as well as tackling problems that may seem unsolvable or risky. May pose a problem in such a way that it interests and attracts other people. Prefers to lead not by volitional administrative approach, but by methods of persuasion. Builds relations with members of his team on basis of voluntary submission on their part. The wishes of manager of this type are often perceived as orders.</p>
<p>Supervisor-creator encourages novel trends, developments, and techniques in any business. Routine matters, including monitoring and instruction of new workers, lie beyond his attention. The main thing - is to find supporters who would take on the practical implementation of the idea. Compensates for the lack of control by delegating authority and responsibility. Aims to achieve high performance and great results by encouraging group work, setting priorities in resolving problems, stimulating independent analysis, and by recognition of significant factors of work towards future prospects.</p>
<p>Such management in practice leads to destruction of old organizational structures and creation of new structures, that are adapted to changes in conditions or to resolution of some existing problems. Therefore, this style of leadership is not always suitable for fields of production. It is more acceptable in research and scientific activities, and not at all suitable for army.</p>
<p>Supervisor of this type is inclined to solve problems collectively, giving everyone a chance to speak. However, if the arguments of the opposing side seem unconvincing, he will spare no effort to prove otherwise. Seeks to work with those people who support his ideational position and share his vision of the future. If necessity arises, he is able to compete with others: successfully in the realm of ideas that requires polemical intensity, and less successfully in purely organizational matters. In his relations with others tends to be objective and adhere to the principles of justice. On occasion may react inadequately in a dispute. Quickly calms down once he makes sure that there is no personal agenda motivating counter actions.</p>
<p>Main characteristics:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Better at solving strategic problems.</p></li>
<li><p>Can adequately realize himself as a frontal leader.</p></li>
<li><p>In making business contacts orients by objective criteria.</p></li>

<p>The impetus for ILE’s work is orientation at originality. It is necessary that work is interesting to him and provides him with opportunities for personal growth and self-development. Even better if his work is research-related and one-of-a-kind within its field development. Assigning this type of work to ILE, it is necessary to convey to him that only he can carry it out due to his intelligence, knowledge, insightfulness, and originality. After completion, praise him in the same manner, taking note of his exceptional abilities. Then try to quickly find new, more interesting work for him, because once sense of novelty is lost the ILE quickly loses interest in his tasks and assignments. If the ILE hasn’t finished something, hasn’t done his assignment as was intended or planned, or completed work of poor quality (this is often true of physical, routine parts of his job), it’s best to “close your eyes” on this and to entrust the further operational development to another specialist. The ILE is not able to constantly take care of his appearance and health; this tends to slip by his attention. It’s best if someone else takes care of setting up and supplying his work place, pays attention to his condition and helps him to improve it. Such treatment relaxes him and reduces his agitation and tension. The ILE can be activated by: gentle humor aimed at him, light banter and jokes, unobtrusive questions designed to draw his attention to himself.</p>

<h2>Recommendations for self-improvement<a class="headerlink" href="#recommendations-for-self-improvement" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Your forte is, undeniably, well-developed learning-oriented thinking. Often, various interesting and promising ideas come to your mind. You are able to see the general essence of events and anticipate how they will unravel further. Your developed intuition helps you to make the right decisions. You read a lot and are interested in all that is new and unusual. But therein lies a certain danger of scattering your interests and losing the main interest that defines you as a person.</p>
<p>The instrument for the realization of your intuitive ideas and guesses is logic. You seek to rationalize your ideas and thereby convince people around you in the correctness of these ideas. Due to this quality, similar-minded people gather around you. You are the enemy of all that is stagnant and outdated. In this lies the danger of a stance of total nihilism. Your main problem is the inability to properly understand the relationships between people. It is especially difficult for you to assess the true attitudes towards yourself.</p>
<p>Once you have intuitively figured out a person, he or she is no longer interesting for you. You don’t know what to do with this person next. This can work to make people dislike you. You also don’t see your true enemies and opposition. Try not to jump to conclusions in your assessment of people around you. To make such assessments, try to orient yourself by people’s objective, observable actions. Then you will be able to figure out the people who are unfriendly, antagonistic, and unsympathetic towards yourself.</p>
<p>You have a difficulty establishing stable, positive relations with people who are close to you. You can accidentally be tactless and disrupt the established harmonious relations. Try to hold back on your immediate reaction towards the various statements or actions of a person who is close and dear to you.</p>
<p>The following recommendations may also be useful to you. Don’t get carried away with excessive democratism, which inconspicuously for you may meld into unneeded familiarity. This could undermine your credibility and your authority. Exercise more tact in your behavior to not shock people with your honesty and straightforwardness. By this you can acquire ill-wishers, without aiming for it yourself.</p>
<p>Another one of your problems is inability to be organized and low self-discipline. Due to this, you lose track of daily chores and upkeep tasks, which may result in disruption of events and future plans that you had in mind. Try to take care of things in timely manner.</p>
<p>If you are the supervisor or manager at work, try not to slip into excessive exercises of your will. Avoid pressuring of your employees unnecessarily. Know where to draw the line. Such an inadequate response can you put into a ridiculous position. Switch your energy into taking up sports, to allow it an outlet. This will raise your vitality, improve your well-being and endurance. You’ll become more collected and disciplined.</p>
