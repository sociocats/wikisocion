<h2>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>Dimensionality of a function</strong> is the number of qualitative
information processing parameters in the framework of which a function
of <a class="reference internal" href="model_a.html"><span class="doc">model A</span></a> is capable of processing information. Each
function has two characteristics: the amount of accumulated experience
and its ability to process information, which is also known as the
“strength” of the function. The concepts of dimensionality was
introduced when it was noticed that a weaker function that has, for one
reason or another, accumulated a lot of experience is easily mistaken
for a strong function, which can lead to errors in typing. To resolve
this issue, the concept of functional dimensionality was proposed by
Kiev socionists (<a class="reference internal" href="bukalov.html"><span class="doc">Bukalov</span></a>, <a class="reference internal" href="ermak.html"><span class="doc">Yermak</span></a>)
and is now widely applied by socionists from various schools. A summary
of this concept is given below.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="four-dimensions">
<h2>Four dimensions<a class="headerlink" href="#four-dimensions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The four information processing parameters of each function of model A
are:</p>
<p><strong>Experience</strong> (<em>Ex</em>) = the ability to recognize patterns and make
generalizations based on personal experience. This is the first
qualitative parameter of information processing of a function. This
parameter is present in all functions - all functions are able to
gather and use life experience of a person. This is the individual
experience of perception of information on some aspect.</p>
<p><strong>Norms</strong> (<em>Nr</em>) = the ability to recognize and apply standard
practices from one’s surroundings. This is the second qualitative
parameter of information processing of a function. Use of norms is
attributable to all functions except for painful and suggestive. This
is information concerning the assessment of the aspect by others,
i.e. an instrument for evaluating it in terms of “as is customary”,
“as it should be”.</p>
<p><strong>Situation</strong> (<em>St</em>) = the ability to recognize and respond to the
subtleties of specific situations. This is the third qualitative
parameter of information processing of a function, that is an
attribute only of strong functions. This is the ability to develop
new solutions within the parameters of a particular situation, i.e.
taking into account situation specific properties and circumstances.</p>
<p><strong>Time</strong> (<em>Tm</em>) = the ability to recognize and envision development
over time. This is the fourth qualitative parameter of information
processing of a function. Time is attributable only to the 1st and
8th functions of model A. This is the ability to evaluate (to
transfer) of the situation in time, to model a situation in another
time frame (not to be confused with the intuition of time).</p>

<p><strong>1-dimensional functions - 4th (vulnerable) and 5th (suggestive)
functions</strong> of Model A. These functions are capable of using only one
parameter of Experience. Absorbing and processing information on the
aspects of 1-dimensional functions is difficult. Here the person relies
only on individual life experience that either he or she has lived
through in the past or has observed of others. In other words, on these
aspects a person learns only on own mistakes, while any explanations are
not accepted and processed. When a new situation arises for which there
is no already available template of behavior, a person may chose the
next readily available one, which may not be entirely appropriate
(inadequate or inappropriate behavior), or may even completely refuse to
respond on the relevant aspects and instead shift emphasis to own strong
functions.</p>
<p><strong>2-dimensional functions - 3rd (role) and 6th (activating) functions</strong>
of model A. These functions are capable of using two parameters of Norms
and Experience. 2-dimensional functions can process both experiential
information and information that comes from “theory” i.e. from
experience of other people with no need to personally live through it,
that is, from collective experiences that form social norms. On the
aspects of these functions a person is able to learn from explanations
and books written by others on how it “should be” and about typical
solutions and normative methods. However, the person further proceeds to
use this information in a standardized manner, not taking into account
the specifics of various situations i.e. without situation appropriate
modification of this information.</p>
<p><strong>3-dimensional functions - 2nd (creative) and 7th (ignoring)
functions</strong> of model A. These functions are capable of using three
parameters of Situation, Norms, and Experience. 3-dimensional functions
can process information on their aspects accounting for personal
experience, norms, as well as the specifics of the current situation. As
a result, these functions are characterized by creative use of
accumulated experience and “theory”, adapting these to the concurrent
situation or applying this information to completely different fields.
They are able to combine person’s experience from different life
situations in such a way that it allows to solve some new problems in
new situations that a person hasn’t previously encountered.</p>
<p><strong>4-dimensional functions - 1st (leading) and 8th (demonstrative)
functions</strong> of model A. These functions are capable of using four
parameters of Time, Situation, Norms, and Experience. 4-dimensional
functions can process information of their aspects accounting for
experience, norms, situation, as well as time, that is, they can
transfer their assessment of a given situation along the time axis. This
gives 4-dimensional functions high proficiency in prognosing of
information on their aspects. These functions are capable of working
“ahead of time” i.e. seeing the different contingencies and results of
some experience or situation before its realization. Ability to compound
diverse situations over time allows 4-dimensional functions to derive
some general global level understanding on their aspects, that serves as
main pool of understanding for a person and that is difficult to convey
in its entirety. These functions are capable of coming up with something
that is radically new in principle.</p>

<h2>Other Notes on Function Dimensionality<a class="headerlink" href="#other-notes-on-function-dimensionality" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Addendum to 4-dimensional functions written by <a class="reference internal" href="eglit.html"><span class="doc">Irina Eglit</span></a> in “Four Parameters: experience, norms,
situation, and time (or globality)”:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>“Let’s imagine that you were shown a single frame of a situation and
asked how you would you act in this case? Your data processing in
this case will depend on the dimensionality of the function. The
3-dimensional function will process the information that is presented
by this single frame situation to decide how to act in this
situation. The 4-dimensional function will process the information
concerning this single frame situation, and all the frames preceding
that frame, and all the possible follow-up shots, to come to a
decision. The 4-dimensional function cannot simply be limited to the
situation, for it does not see the situation as static but as a
development. Therefore, the solution coming from these two functions
will be different. The 4th dimension - is a dynamic perception of the
ever-changing world.”(c)</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>1-dimensional functions from <a class="reference external" href="http://en.socionicasys.org/teorija/dlja-novichkov/funkcii/razmernost/odnomernost">School of System
Socionics</a>
page:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Any information that ends up in a one-dimensional function is
assessed by the function as pleasant or unpleasant. Natural (from the
viewpoint of one-dimensional function) reaction when encountering an
“unpleasant” information is the desire to get rid of it, to turn
away, not to take it into account, to pretend that it does not exist,
to forget, to fence off in any way.</p>
<p>One of the methods of “getting away” is mental time hastening - “I
wish it ends quickly,” which leads to the feverishness of the
function. Thinking becomes impatient, shallow and very narrow. It can
be compared with the rapid running through dark places, when your
field of vision is narrowed to a spot, you do not want to see
anything around. Reactions are accelerated, there is haste. We are
hurriedly doing something to get rid of the unpleasant thing faster:
we quickly tinker through our relationship, we hastily make our
calculation, or in general, we quickly react to the information
related to the element of our one-dimensional function. This, of
course, often leads to mistakes, and we get the opposite of what we
have hoped for - we do not get rid of the unwanted situation, we make
it worse. Trying to “run through” the situation at high speed, just
to feel relieved that it’s over, deep down, we still feel that we are
failing and we feel “suspended.”</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>From “Structure of Model A” published at Socionics Research Institute:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>“In presence of harmonious development, these 4 vectors are balanced
in an individual. If one or more of these vectors are amplified in
comparison to others, it may indicate distortions in development.
If a person has strengthened vector of globality, this is reflected
by the fact that he sees things globally, such as projects, events,
and people, and can see significant developments and challenges; at
the same time he exaggerates their value.
If a person has strengthened vector of situation, this is reflected
in the fact that he easily orients in different situations, quickly
and successfully adapts to events, and finds many creative solutions;
at the same time he may be opportunistic and easily change his
opinion and position.
If a person has strengthened vector of norms, he carefully and
accurately follows social norms and standards in both work and
informal communication, in appearance, in style of speech (as he
understands them), and ensures that the rules and the order are not
violated.
If a person has strengthened vector of personal experience, in most
situations he relies primarily on himself or herself, on own
experience and own opinions, while ignoring the opinions of others
and not learning from the mistakes of others; he cannot broadly and
creatively look at the situation, and evaluates people “by his own
yardstick”.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>From Sociomodel.ru:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>“To give a simplified figurative example of the above descriptions,
explaining anything on a 1-dimensional function, that “one should not
step on the rake”, is meaningless: until a person steps on the rake
and gets hit by it, he or she won’t “absorb” any recommendations and
explanations; then, after getting hit by the rake, a person may not
understand why this has happened and in the future may avoid anything
resembling a rake even distantly (1-dimensional functions have skewed
and distorted perception). A 2-dimensional function will understand
and remember the advice that “one should not step on a rake”, but it
will remember it in a formulaic sense and always apply it, even in
situations when it’s possible to break this rule without any
consequences (such as when a rake is standing vertically against a
wall), until once again a person tries this out directly. In contrast
to a 2-dimensional function, a 3-dimensional function is capable of
seeing and distinguishing such “exceptional” situations. Finally, a
4-dimensional function does not need to be given such advice: looking
at the rake, it is capable of perceiving what consequences can arise
as a result of stepping on it.”</p>
