<h2>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>Duality</strong> is the relations of two TIMs that fit each other ideally
according to <a class="reference internal" href="model_a.html"><span class="doc">Model A</span></a> according to the principles of
complementarity. Duality is a fundamental concept of socionics, and was
introduced by <a class="reference internal" href="augusta.html"><span class="doc">Aushra Augusta</span></a>.</p>
<p>Duals can interact on many levels and in a variety of ways, which
creates a sense of fullness and variety in the relationship. Duals
almost always bring something unexpected to the relationship for the
other person and end up affecting them in ways they did not expect. This
is because duals see certain abilities, problems, and traits in each
other person that the other person is not fully aware of. However, duals
must remove psychological barriers in order for expectations to be met
completely. Otherwise, they will be unsatisfied.</p>
<p>In dual relations one partner’s <a class="reference internal" href="model_a.html#ego-block"><span class="std std-ref">ego</span></a> <a class="reference internal" href="functions.html"><span class="doc">functions</span></a>
(1 and 2) fill the expectations of the other person’s
<a class="reference internal" href="model_a.html#superid-block"><span class="std std-ref">Super-Id</span></a> functions (5 and 6). Likewise, duals’
<a class="reference internal" href="model_a.html#superego-block"><span class="std std-ref">Super-Ego</span></a> and <a class="reference internal" href="model_a.html#id-block"><span class="std std-ref">Id</span></a> blocks, though less important
to the individuals’ lives, interact with each other in complementary
ways. Duals help each other to face their super-ego troubles in a
healthy way, usually indirectly.</p>
<p>Descriptions of duality often assume that the relationship is romantic
and between people of the opposite sex. But it should be noted that dual
relations occur between same-sex partners, in non-romantic friendship,
in various settings, (e.g. at work,) and between people with different
backgrounds.</p>

<h3>In friendships<a class="headerlink" href="#in-friendships" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Problems between Duality partners has an almost uncanny way of working
itself out. Things that dual partners do that are cruel or mean-hearted
in the eyes of external observers are often passed over as meaningless
by the other partner. At the same time, common activities are often
romanticized and seen as extremely meaningful to dual partners.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="at-work">
<h3>At work<a class="headerlink" href="#at-work" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>It is sometimes hard to notice your dual in the workplace at first, but
once you do, they quickly become much more enjoyable to work with than
others. When you start to connect, it can often make you wonder “wow!
how did i miss this before?” Your dual will defend you against the petty
squibbling of other coworkers, as well as aid you in the basic, mundane
tasks of the job, making life a lot easier and much less stressful. It
can sometimes be hard to stay on task when you get carried away
communicating, which is often broken up by a supervisor who brings the
duals back to “reality.” If duals develop their relationship properly
and take an interest in each other, the extravert can show initiative in
forming a more intimate relationship (friendship or romance).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="in-romance">
<h3>In romance<a class="headerlink" href="#in-romance" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Romantic relationships affect the most intimate areas of a person’s
functioning, so dualization in this area will have the greatest affect
on a person’s life.</p>
<p>The early stages of a dual romance may be similar to any other
relationship where infatuation is present, but what is different is the
psychological distance between the partners. The naturally close
distance causes partners to relax internally and be more spontaneous
than they would be in most other relationships. Duals quickly recognize
that their partner is not overly concerned with their weaknesses and is
not going to criticize sore spots. In romance dual partners quickly move
from stereotyped romantic behavior to what is actually natural and
sincere for them. Partners may find that they “discover themselves”
through the dual relationship. By seeking out their true desires and
natural tendencies and ignoring societal expectations, they actually
enrich the relationship and gladden their partner. If a person has not
enjoyed dual relations before, experiencing them for the first time will
likely be a transformational experience. In the initial stage of a dual
relationship, partners often “drop out” of society for a period of time
to devote energy to the new relationship and the exciting process of
self-discovery.</p>
<p>After infatuation diminishes, stable romantic relationships between
duals generally grow into tender friendships with a strong element of
playfulness. No matter how old the relationship is, duals are
continually able to press their partner’s buttons through playfully
“tickling” his or her <a class="reference internal" href="functions.html#suggestive-func"><span class="std std-ref">suggestive function</span></a>.
Since this is the person’s <a class="reference internal" href="functions.html#leading-func"><span class="std std-ref">base function</span></a>, this comes
naturally, even automatically. Often, simply displaying very typical
behaviors associated with the partner’s suggestive function makes the
other person smile or laugh. Over the long term, duals tend to divide
responsibilities for different areas of their life together along the
lines of their <a class="reference internal" href="model_a.html#ego-block"><span class="std std-ref">Ego</span></a> functions, even if this contradicts popular
ideas about gender roles. This relieves psychological strain and frees
up energy.</p>
<p>Dual relations in romance develop partners’ individuality, and different
dual pairs may exhibit different external behavior. Some couples may
seem like they fight a lot; in actuality, they are expressing emotions
that neither partner takes personally, and letting off steam and
demonstrating playful aggression may well be part of the “game” that the
partners have developed. Other couples may seem businesslike or even
disinterested in each other in public until you get to know them better.
In each case, the couple’s behavior will center around the elements of
each partner’s <a class="reference internal" href="model_a.html#ego-block"><span class="std std-ref">Ego</span></a> functions  especially the <a class="reference internal" href="functions.html#leading-func"><span class="std std-ref">base
function</span></a>.</p>
<p>Dual romantic relations can have elements of conflict just like any
other as irritation and stress build up and the couple experiences
external pressures. The key difference is the inherent psychological
comfort level and the letting down of barriers that automatically occurs
in dual relations. The conflicts that do arise are usually worked
through carefully (which means different things for each dual pair) and
ultimately enhance the relationship and partners’ individuality.</p>
<p>Dual relations are a “closed system” in that partners in a successful
dual relationship (see disclaimer below) satisfy most of each others’
psychological needs and become a self-sufficient unit. They may seem
closed off and inaccessible to some outsiders, but partners have simply
become more selective about their activities and outside contacts as
they help each other remove unnecessary irritants and stresses in their
lives. Such conditions encourage self-realization, which requires
focusing energy on things that are important to you and ignoring much
else.</p>
<p>Some romantic dual couples who spend the vast majority of their time
together may experience an “identity blurring” effect. In this
circumstance, the couple may lose most sense of distinction between one
another, functioning not as two parts of a whole, but merely as a whole
itself. This can be accompanied by a distancing of the idea of the
individuals’ physical selves and names from the actual conception of the
partner. This can eventually reach point where the partner becomes
difficult to conceive of or even picture externally– as though images
of them or their name are actually referring to some third old friend
whom the partner has not seen in a while. Duality in this form could
well be termed “integration”; neither partner could fully define their
identity without some inclusion of the other.</p>
<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong></p>
<p>All of the above  as well as numerous other descriptions of dual
relations  assumes that partners have an unfeigned, deep interest in
each other and genuinely fell in love. In many cases duals do not form
romantic relationships because they are indifferent to each other or
there are important differences between them that keep them from
considering a relationship in the first place. Dual relations only imply
a certain close psychological distance and ease of interaction. If
partners are not compatible with each other in other ways, but form a
relationship anyway, they will have unresolvable conflicts despite the
psychological comfort. This leads partners to not involve each other in
many of their activities, show less interest in the other person’s inner
life, and be less conscientious and understanding. Such a relationship
will not be completely fulfilling, and partners will not feel united.
Even if partners are united and experience all of the above description,
there is no guarantee that something non-socionic may cause them to
separate at some point, although the likelihood of this is probably less
than for other relationships.</p>

<h3>Meeting<a class="headerlink" href="#meeting" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>According to socionics.com “Nature has played a little trick on us. It
is difficult to notice your Dual partner among all the other types and
even easier to pass them by. Usually during first contact extroverts
think about their introvert Dual as ordinary and simple, therefore not
deserving their personal attention. In return introverts consider their
extrovert Dual to be too good for them and therefore unattainable. Both
positions usually belong to people who had a lack of Duality interaction
during childhood.”</p>
<p>It is also possible that duals pass each other by because when they
first meet they are likely to act through their Super-Ego functions,
which is received with boredom from the other party.</p>

<p><a class="reference internal" href="augusta.html"><span class="doc">Augusta</span></a>, herself in an unhappy marriage, may have
exaggerated the role of duality in human life. There has been an
unspoken assumption that duals are “specially designed” for each other.
Indeed, Augusta remarks in one of her works, it is unclear from <a class="reference internal" href="model_a.html"><span class="doc">Model A</span></a> how people even function without duals. The answer to her
question may be that people pick up different kinds of information in
bits and pieces from lots of different sources, not only from the
specific person that they are in a close relationship with.</p>
<p>Discussions about whether or not people are “meant” to be with duals are
like discussions about whether humans are monogamous or polygamous by
nature. There is always disagreement and arguments in favor of both
sides. Most socionists believe dual relations play a special role in
people’s lives, but dual relations are generally not seen as the cure
for all psychological and social ills as Augusta seemed to suggest in
her works.</p>
<p>Simplified descriptions of <a class="reference internal" href="intertype.html"><span class="doc">intertype relations</span></a>, including duality, sometimes give
the impression that they are all the same, or that duals are somehow
supposed to “balance” each other or “neutralize” each other’s
weaknesses, so that every dual couple will end up looking the same or
having the same kind of relationship. This is a misconception. Like the
16 types, all the 8 dualities are distinct, since what each dual pair of
types expects of a relationship is different from the others.</p>

<p>Duals are on opposite poles of the <a class="reference internal" href="jungian.html"><span class="doc">Jungian dichotomies</span></a> of Extroversion / Introversion,
Logic / Ethics, and Intuition / Sensing, but on the same pole of the
Rational / Irrational dichotomy. This accounts for duals having a common
