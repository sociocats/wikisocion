<h3>Democrats<a class="headerlink" href="#id1" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Democrat perceives and distinguishes himself primarily through
personal qualities. Perceiving other people, their personal qualities
are likewise primary for him (how close, interesting, pleasant or
unpleasant this individual is to him personally; their intelligence,
ideas, appearance, tastes, etc.). Because of this, individualism is
inherent to the democrat: “I am I”.</p></li>
<li><p>Democrat forms his attitude toward a specific person based on their
personal characteristics (authority, intellect, personal
achievements, etc.). The democrat recognizes superiority of certain
individuals drawing from their personal qualities. The relation of
the democrat to another person will not be based on their belonging
to one group or another, as well as on their relations to the
representatives of these groups.</p></li>
<li><p>Democratic types are not inclined to perceive people with whom they
associate as representatives of a certain “circle of contacts”, which
possesses special characteristics, inherent precisely to the members
of this circle.</p></li>
<li><p>Democrat is not inclined to use expressions that generalize “group
features” of certain individuals (for example, “a typical
representative”).</p></li>

</div>
<div class="section" id="id2">
<h3>Aristocrats<a class="headerlink" href="#id2" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The aristocrat frequently perceives and defines himself an other
people through group associations (division into groups can occur
based on almost any criteria: professional or theoretical, by age or
nationality, by place of residence or which floor the persons live
on, etc.), for example: “I’m a representative of…” “This person is
from such and such…”. Collectivism is more inherent to the
aristocrat.</p></li>
<li><p>Their attitude toward another person forms under the influence of
their attitude towards the group to which the person belongs. To the
aristocrat, it is incomprehensible how it is possible to belong to
two opposing groups at the same time: “You are either with us, or
with them and against us”.</p></li>
<li><p>Aristocrat distinguished his “circle of contacts” by certain traits,
realizes its certain “specialty”.</p></li>
<li><p>In speech aristocrat frequently use expressions like “group”,
“typical representative of”, “our”, “all of them are like that”, etc.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Notes</strong></p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Briefly, the essence of each of these attributes can be expressed as
follows: primacy of collective “we” (Aristocrats) or of individual
“I” (Democrats) and the corresponding values.</p></li>
<li><p>It is possible to say that the aristocrat is to a larger degree a
social being, an the democratindividualistic. Therefore, the dispute
of what is more importantsociety or the individualcannot be
resolved.</p></li>
<li><p>From the point of view of social psychology, in perception of a new
person the aristocrat strongly involves the mechanism of social
recognition: casual attribution (the degree depends on uniqueness and
social conditionality of behavior) and “halo/aura” effect (which
manifests when the individual has little information about a new
person). Both of them are a part of the process of stereotyping
(perception/recognition through a stereotype) [1, with. 128].</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Hypotheses</strong></p>
<p><em>Aristocrats:</em> Ethical intuitive types create new groups (“inhabitants
of suburbs”, “typical representative of a new generation of
goalkeepers”)adding up or summing up certain cumulative features which
are inherent in the majority. Logical sensing types use these groupings
that have been created by ethical intuitives, switching to their strong
logical function and building a system of personal relations on its
basis.</p>
<p><em>Democrats:</em> In perception of a democrat, a group is created from
individuals drawn together on basis of a common interest, project, idea
(for logical intuitive types) or on basis of mutual sentiments and
sympathies (for ethical sensing types). Additionally, a group in
perception of democratic types is not the basis for creating a social
hierarchy.</p>
<p><strong>Influence of this attribute on determination of the type of
personality</strong></p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Hierarchy and status are frequently described as inherent to
structural logic (Ti). According to our observations this is entirely
false. White logic (Ti) types of the first quadra will adhere to
formal requirements, but will not begin to reconstruct all of their
behavior in accordance to a new status. In this manner will act the
aristocrats of the second quadra, most obviously the sensing logical
types. Some confusion can arise due to this. If we were to observe,
we would see that other aristocratic types are no less inclined to
such “status games”, for example “I demand that they relate to me as
the director” (EIE), “I cannot associate with those of a higher
position than me” (IEE).</p></li>
<li><p>Division of people into “mine” and “not mine” is frequently
attributed to aristocracy. In actuality, this division holds true for
any types that values white ethics (Fi), including the democratic
types (SEE, and in particular ESI). If we expand this concept, then
“my” is any person with whom close relations have been formed, there
is a familiar connection or sincere attachment. For the IEE an EII
sincere attachment and belonging to a group become combined: “mine”
and “not mine” for them are members of “their group” or “foreign
group”.</p></li>
<li><p>Switching from “you” to “formal you” [Russian language and a few
other languages have formal and informal forms of reference] is not
always significant from the point of view of manifestation of this
attribute. According to the standards of etiquette and rules of
behavior, it is accepted to address older people and those in senior
position with formal form of “you” (with respect), and different
informal situations, regardless of the rules, require switch to
informal “you”. For instance if a child’s mother is the teacher in
his class, then the child will refer to her with formal “you” in
class. It is possible to give more example of this. The important
thing is not how they are addressed, but the reason for doing so.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Examples</strong></p>
<p><em>Democrats:</em> “I’m not interested in social affiliations of a person or
other social ‘marks’ they may have” “I don’t even have thoughts of
establishing someone’s affiliations to any groups. A person is a unit”
“It is important what the individual represents” “When I interact with
somebody I don’t really care whether they are a man or a woman” “It is
difficult for me to determine what constitutes belonging to a group, I
cannot isolate that something that differentiates from others” “I am a
representative only of my own ideas” “I notice groups, but it’s just a
game (they are not real, the groups are pretended)”.</p>
<p><em>Aristocrats:</em> “I perceive people based on their group affiliations,
place everyone “on a shelf” (“a good mother”, “a charming person”,
etc.)” “If it is possible to determine in which grouping the person
belongs, then this is reassuring. It is easier to receive information
from someone knowing which group they are a part of” “I separate people
based on their professional capabilities. First: to what social and
economic stratus the person belongs to. Second: is he a professional or
not, the way he conducts himself, his individual qualities” “I am
referring to you as to a typical representative of translators” “At my
workplace they hired a new secretary recently, and she works poorly, and
in general is not that kind of a person. May be because she is from the
suburbs… please don’t misunderstand me, I’m not an aristocrat! I’m
not!” “For me this religion means nothing, but for the ordinary people
it is necessary” “You are my friend, but my friends don’t steal toilet
paper from McDonalds!”</p>
<p><strong>Investigation of Quadra Attributes:</strong> The concept of a “quadra spirit”
or “quara values” can be expressed through the filling of three quadra
attributes. Thus, for example, a song from 1930: “We shall sing and
laugh alike children, in persistent struggle and labor”was composed by
a person belonging to the second quadra, not because of the “quadra
spirit”, but because two attributes are embedded within itsubjectivism
and decisivenessthe combination of which exists only in the second
quadra.</p>

<h2>Additional Commentary and Notes<a class="headerlink" href="#additional-commentary-and-notes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>See also: <a class="reference external" href="http://zhilkin.com/socio/en/">Sociotypograph  determine your sociotype by Renin dichotomies</a>.</p>
<p>It has been noted that there exists a considerable overlap in traits
assigned to Aristocratic/Democratic dichotomy in socionics and to
instincts and instinctual combinations in the enneagram model, leading
to frequent confusions of their properties. The descriptions of the
valued Social instinct, in particular, outline a similar set of traits
to the ones attributed to Aristocratic types in Reinin dichotomies. Here
is a sample description of valued Social instinct from <a class="reference external" href="http://www.enneagraminstitute.com/articles/nartinstvar.asp">Enneagram Institute</a>:</p>
<p>“<strong>Social</strong>: <em>This subtype is focused on their interactions with other
people and with the sense of value or esteem they derive from their
participation in collective activities. These include work, family,
hobbies, clubsbasically any arena in which Social types can interact
with others for some shared purpose. … Within that social instinct,
however, are many other implicit imperatives, and primary among them is
the understanding of “place” within a hierarchical social structure.</em>”</p>
<p>That is, valued Social instinct is associated with greater awareness of
social and cultural spheres of life, social norms and conventions,
social standing and hierarchies, and the inclination to participate in
the collective activities. All of this may be mistakenly interpreted as
socionics “Aristocratic” trait (especially for stackings that have
secondary Social instinct, for whom the social sphere is often an area
of creative exploration). Conversely, social-last stackings sp/sx and
sx/sp possess a lowered awareness of the social and cultural spheres,
decreased interest in group activities and collective themes, and
exhibit greater social insularity and even disregard or rejection of
social norms and conventions, which is easily confused with socionics
“Democratic” traits.</p>
<p>Since the differences between the socionics Aristocratic/Democratic
trait and properties of the enneagram social instinct have never been
clearly explained, <strong>it is inadvisable to rely on this dichotomy in
typing.</strong></p>

Like I said, I was out of my element with this girl, duals are
jealous around each other. She felt the same way. Please, know your
place woman.” IEI in response - ‘“Know <em>your</em> place. If you’re not
seeing each other exclusively you have no right to treat her as your
exclusive property and think you somehow have a “right” to determine
who she can/can’t hang out with and “punish” her accordingly, duality
or not. And even then it’s questionable. Grow up, grow balls, etc.”</p></li>

<p>Stratievskaya on “Aristocratic” quadra and relations (excepts from
various blog entries):</p>
<p>From <a class="reference external" href="http://www.the16types.info/vbulletin/showthread.php/43943-Article-Mirage-Relations-INTp-and-ENFp-by-Stratiyevskaya">IEE-ILI mirage relations</a>:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>“For example, one may leave for a vacation and ask the IEE to
complete some task or activity, and upon return find it ruined in all
respects, with no further possibility to restore it or straighten
things out. There was agreement  then there was no agreement, and
why is this?  there won’t be any answer. At best IEE will reply: “I
did not hire myself out to work for you!” (aristocracy).”</p></li>
<li><p>“Furthermore, here we have interaction between a “democratic” type
and an “aristocratic” type: IEE dislikes being a servant to and doing
errands for the ILI. The mere hint of such a possibility is annoying
to the IEE. Therefore, under any circumstances he tries not to give
in to any hints, suggestions, requests, or even demands of ILI. He
attempts to stay on the dominant position under any circumstances,
from the heights of which IEE dispenses the necessary assistance at
the right time in the form of valuable advice, as a knowledgeable
person and as a seasoned professional.”</p></li>
</ul>
<p>From <a class="reference external" href="http://www.the16types.info/vbulletin/showthread.php/43189-Article-Semi-duality-Relations-INFj-and-ENTj-by-Stratiyevskaya">EII-LIE semi-duality relations</a>:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>“LIE will have difficulty understanding and dealing with the “petty”
(aristocratic, ceremonious) ethics of relations of EII, since LIE is
subconsciously oriented at democratic ethic of relations of his dual
ESI, whose ethical function is directed at providing immediate and
effective assistance in critical situations and not at “ceremonious”
regulation of relationships. Therefore, the callowness and
negligibility of EII’s grievances and offenses will soon start to
annoy the LIE: “How can he (EII) become so offended over such minor
things!”</p></li>
<li><p>“This is something that I (EII) did not like in him (LIE) - his
attitude towards women. He did not indulge them, did not tell them
beautiful compliments - he did not idolize his women. No - he was a
kind and attentive man. I never heard a bad word from him, but
neither did he voice any compliments - such a person he was. He has
never told me that he loved me, or even that he missed me …
(Aristocratic, subordinate to rituals ethics of relations of EII is
not consistent with the democratic, free from accumulations of ritual
relations ethics of 3rd quadra. Each quadra has its own code of
ethics.)”</p></li>

<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Aristocrats have the <strong>logical</strong> and <strong>sensing</strong> <a class="reference internal" href="elements.html"><span class="doc">IM elements</span></a> in the same blocks of <a class="reference internal" href="model_a.html"><span class="doc">Model A</span></a>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Here is a possible interpretation of this:</p>
<p><em>Material assets are systematized and automated. Systems and production
have a material expression. Ideas exist for people and societal
relationships. People and relationships are valued for their personality
and potential.</em></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Democrats have the <strong>ethical</strong> and ‘’’sensing ‘’’ <a class="reference internal" href="elements.html"><span class="doc">IM elements</span></a> in the same blocks of <a class="reference internal" href="model_a.html"><span class="doc">Model A</span></a>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Here is a possible interpretation of this:</p>
<p><em>Material assets exist for people and societal relationships. Systems
and production are intangible or out of sight. Ideas and vision exist
for technology and systems. People and relationships are valued for
their effect and their comfort.</em></p>
<p>When analyzing this dichotomy from the perspective of <a class="reference internal" href="model_a.html"><span class="doc">model A</span></a>, <a class="reference internal" href="augusta.html"><span class="doc">Augusta</span></a> listed all the blocks in this
dichotomy (so <img alt="symbol_l.gif" src="../_images/symbol_l.gif"/> with <img alt="symbol_f.gif" src="../_images/symbol_f.gif"/>, <img alt="symbol_e.gif" src="../_images/symbol_e.gif"/> with
<img alt="symbol_t.gif" src="../_images/symbol_t.gif"/> etc for Aristocracy and <img alt="symbol_f.gif" src="../_images/symbol_f.gif"/> with
<img alt="symbol_r.gif" src="../_images/symbol_r.gif"/>, <img alt="symbol_p.gif" src="../_images/symbol_p.gif"/> with <img alt="symbol_t.gif" src="../_images/symbol_t.gif"/> etc for Democracy),
attributing specific traits to each block which she extended to
characteristics of each dichotomy as whole. They are not all obviously
connected to a focus or lack thereof on groups as per the most common
definition of this dichotomy and as listed in the “typical
characteristics” section below.</p>
<p>A possible explanation for this trait regarding group thinking goes as
follows. Aristocratic reasoning merely structures
logically(<img alt="symbol_l.gif" src="../_images/symbol_l.gif"/>) characteristics they have observed
(<img alt="symbol_f.gif" src="../_images/symbol_f.gif"/>) in several individuals, being thus a logical
“connecting of the dots” applied to people. From a purely logical
<img alt="symbol_l.gif" src="../_images/symbol_l.gif"/> perspective applied to <img alt="symbol_f.gif" src="../_images/symbol_f.gif"/> perceptions and
goals, it makes perfect sense to assume that, if you perceive an
individual as belonging to a group posssessing some traits you have
already concluded are characteristic of that group, said individual will
exhibit those traits. For example, if in your experience so far
(<img alt="symbol_f.gif" src="../_images/symbol_f.gif"/>) all persons belonging to a particular division in a
company have been unhelpful, it makes sense to conclude logically
(<img alt="symbol_l.gif" src="../_images/symbol_l.gif"/>) in a purely impersonal way that that is a
characteristic of that division, and extrapolate that to further persons
from that group. From the point of view of primitive societies or
situations of non-organized warfare and conflict, such a reasoning may
even be crucial for survival since it allows you to estimate who your
enemies are before they attack you.</p>
<p>By contrast, the Democratic reasoning focuses on observations
<img alt="symbol_f.gif" src="../_images/symbol_f.gif"/> on a case-by-case basis, that is of the individual they
happen to be interacting with at the moment (<img alt="symbol_r.gif" src="../_images/symbol_r.gif"/>). A focus on
<img alt="symbol_r.gif" src="../_images/symbol_r.gif"/> does not lead to creating logical structures, but to
forming stable connections to persons on individual-to-indvidual basis,
and in that case there is no point to, and no inclination for,
considerations of whether the observed reality <img alt="symbol_f.gif" src="../_images/symbol_f.gif"/> of the
person fits into a broader logical structure of a group
(<img alt="symbol_l.gif" src="../_images/symbol_l.gif"/>).</p>
<p>This explanation seems more obvious in connection to the <a class="reference internal" href="beta_quadra.html"><span class="doc">Beta</span></a>
quadra; far less so in the case of <a class="reference internal" href="delta_quadra.html"><span class="doc">Delta</span></a> since the
<img alt="symbol_f.gif" src="../_images/symbol_f.gif"/> + <img alt="symbol_l.gif" src="../_images/symbol_l.gif"/> block is subdued. Another way of
explaining this for <a class="reference internal" href="delta_quadra.html"><span class="doc">Delta</span></a> might be through the
<img alt="symbol_i.gif" src="../_images/symbol_i.gif"/> + <img alt="symbol_r.gif" src="../_images/symbol_r.gif"/> block; on the basis that the realization
of someone’s potential (<img alt="symbol_i.gif" src="../_images/symbol_i.gif"/>) is realized via connections with
others (<img alt="symbol_r.gif" src="../_images/symbol_r.gif"/>), and that one of Delta’s characteristics is the
formation of groups towards worthy and productive goals.</p>
