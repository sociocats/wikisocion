<h3>Strategy<a class="headerlink" href="#id2" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Strategic types focus their attention on a “point” they wish to

events themselves.</p></li>
<li><p>Strategists, as a rule, do not fix their direction i.e. concrete

“trajectory” by which they move towards fulfilling their goals can

<li><p>They assess their actions and choices from the point of view of how
closer they bring them to their desired objectives (goals). Being put
before a choice, they reject those options that do not bring them
closer.</p></li>
<li><p>In analyzing past, Strategists accentuate “key moments” (most
significant stages) that led them to present point. They do not
consider all versions of events as equivalent (they perceive the
version that has actualized separately, by itself)</p></li>
<li><p>They consciously set goals and have difficulty scrapping them. May
experience confusion if they are forced to change a goal. They
experience satisfaction in achieving their set objectives (goals) and
disappointment if they had to deviate away from it or could not
achieve it.</p></li>
<li><p>Strategists consciously operate with goals. In situations where
Strategists have several goals, they sort and arrange their goals
into a hierarchy.</p></li>
<li><p>Without having a conscious goal, Strategists feel as if something is
missing and their life is incomplete. They experience discomfort and
feel disoriented.</p></li>
<li><p>Lexicon: in their speech Strategists often use words “goal” “aim” and
other versions of this. Strategists clearly express their goals and
purposes, precisely formulate and describe them, do not substitute
them with other concepts unlike Tacticians.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Notes</strong></p>
<p>The key element in understanding this group is the dichotomy of
“goal/purposemethod/pathway”. The consciousness of the Strategist is to
a larger degree orientated towards the goal/purpose itself and not
towards the actions undertaken in process of achieving it, while the
consciousness of the Tactician is largely focused on the path i.e. the
actual actions (“steps”) but not their end goal. This encompasses not
only the conscious activities of individuals, which decisions they
undertake, and so on, but also external circumstances, background
events, and other concurrent factors. On a general level it is possible
to speak about a difference in “reference points”: either the course is
corrected in accordance to some fixed goal (Strategist) or the course
becomes fixed and goals become variable (Tactician).</p>
<p><strong>Hypotheses</strong></p>
<p>Tactical types feel disappointment upon reaching a goal in cases when
they had to deviate from their course. This is because the course or
pathway is more important for Tactical types than their goal. Thus, in
situations when their purpose came to the foreground before their
course, they experienced discomfort. This is further aggravated for
Rational Tacticals, who, by their nature, are inclined to plan their
actions, and feel great discomfort if their plans come apart. On the
other hand, a feeling of emptiness arises because when a goal has been
reached the course is interrupted. Tactical types feel as if the ground
temporarily leaves from under their feet. The sensation of confidence,
resoluteness that accompanies their normal mode of life disappears. When
they were “moving along their own path”, everything was clear and easy.
Upon reaching a goal, even if it was a much desired one, Tactical types
lose their “string” and often do not know how to proceed further and
what to do next.</p>
<p><strong>Examples</strong></p>
<p><em>Tacticians:</em> “To speak of global goals is difficult, a goal is several
localized tasks” “I do not see one big goal, but rather a chain of small
ones” “I pick up everything as I go along” “Long term goals… well I
reach them, but somehow it all occurs crookedly” “If I ever set an end
goal, I would have died! Such a thing does not exit for me” “There are
multiple goals at the end of each path that you take. I try to “catch”
them along the way” “My way, for a long time, was clear to me” “There
are many things that I could have done, but haven’t” “There are many
ways in which my life could have unfolded. I could have lived in
different places, could have had other professions” “If I was another
person, everything could have been different” “When I look back and
think about the things that could have been, I see many crossroads. I
see myself, as I am living after taking a different turnin another
universe”</p>
<p><em>Strategists:</em> “The point is not whether the goal is big or small, but
in being aware of it. The goal is clear, the course is undefined… I
don’t always remember how I accomplish what I have in mind” “I was a
slave to my goal” “A goal constitutes the central point of
self-organization. I feel ashamed that some goals are left unfulfilled,
even if they are insignificant… if a goal was drawn you can’t really
erase it” “A global goal is a comforting thought. If the criteria of a
course satisfies the criteria set by the goal, I will take it” “There
aren’t any “distractions” along the way” “A person must have a goal in
life, otherwisewhat’s the point?” “A huge list35 items of what I want
to accomplish in my life” “A person cannot always clearly state that
what he wishes to accomplish, but nevertheless they accomplish it…
minor questions I do not consider, I aim somewhere further than that”
“There are such moment in ones lifecardinal moments,where if I failed
to do something I wanted, it would not have been me… I always look
where it would have led me” “Every act leads somewhere” “There were many
“key moments”. The important thing was how they shortened or prolonged
my movement towards the end point” “I keep track of “key moments” and
can list them one by one. I regret that because of lack of experience I
could not solve some problems effectively, and because of this it took
longer time for me to reach my goal… One way or another, I would have
reached the result that I wanted to reach.”</p>

<h2>Examples<a class="headerlink" href="#examples" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Interaction of of two strategic types taken from Vera Stratievskaya’s
EII-LIE semi-duality description:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Both EII and LIE are also strategic types: if they instigate
something, it will be something substantial and they won’t stop
halfway at achieving this goal. Partners-strategists simply put each
other before the fact that something is already planned and requires
realization and active participation of the other partner. They do so
without carefully considering means and capabilities of the other and
without receiving his or her advice and consent. They simply suddenly
“saddle” their partner with an activity or assignment, which in
itself makes each of them feel frustrated. In dual relations, their
enduring, hard-working, tactical, sensing partners LSE and ESI, can
usually handle these “assignments” and help them realize their goals
and plans, through even their energy and strength don’t last forever.
However, in semi-dual relations these two pragmatic and overly
optimistic intuitive types are quickly faced with a mutual rejection
of such plans: who likes it when such important and effort intensive
decisions are made over their heads, regardless of their opinion,
without their consent?  “You want this  you take care of it. Don’t
count on me. I have intended to do something else today.”</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Interaction of of two strategic types SLI-EII:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>I would ask her: “This weekend I’m planning to go to this
presentation. Would you like to come along?” She (SLI) would respond
with: “No, we have important plans for the weekend. Did you forget?
Attend another time.” Me: “Well what plans did we have?” Her: replies
with something hazy. Then she would was just sit in and watch movies
or chat online when the day came.</p></li>
