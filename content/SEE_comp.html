<h1>Wikisocion SEE composite<a class="headerlink" href="#wikisocion-see-composite" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Sensing Ethical Extratim, SEE, <img alt="Se" src="../_images/Symbol_f.gif"/> <img alt="Fi" src="../_images/Symbol_r.gif"/>, ESFp, FR, Politician, Ambassador, or archetype Napoleon I.</p>
<div class="section" id="ego-block">
<h2>Ego Block<a class="headerlink" href="#ego-block" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>SEEs have a high awareness of their social surroundings and of the social influence or “weight” of different people. They are naturals at concentrating social attention on themselves or on anyone else they bring into the limelight. They rarely hesitate to take action in social situations.</p>
<p>SEE has a very sharp understanding of people’s attitude towards his suggestions, as well as their mood in general. The primary method of implementation for the SEE’s goals is changing people’s attitudes to be more in line with his own towards a certain objective.</p>
<div class="section" id="se-extraverted-sensing">
<h3>1. Se Extraverted Sensing<a class="headerlink" href="#se-extraverted-sensing" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The SEE is always present in the here and now. An SEE knows exactly which relations he has influence over at the moment, and exactly how much influence he has (i.e. how far can he “push”). If an SEE wants someone that he does not “have”, he can spend lots of time thinking about how to get it. The SEE finds it hard to be content with what he has.</p>
<p>SEEs are quick to notice confrontational behavior. It is very obvious to an SEE when someone is displaying aggression, even in the most subtle passive-aggressive fashion. Confrontational behavior does not phase the SEE, whether his reaction is to respond with confrontation or hostility himself, creating an outwards appearance of indifference and unimpressiveness, or trying to calm down the offender/make them feel guilty. The various means available to the SEE to achieve the above goals are not nearly as important to the SEE as the end.</p>
<p>The SEE is motivated on some level in all of his affairs towards his goal of exclusiveness. He prefers to be in as high of a position of demand and respect as possible. It fills the SEE with joy to be have many different people competing for his attention and affection. Such a scenario reassures the SEE with the fact that he has been doing things right and that his hard work has paid off. Thus the SEE is often found surrounded by a large circle of friends and romantic interests.</p>
<p>An SEE views material objects as well as people in terms of how they can be used to achieve his goals. Upon losing a superficial friendship or a materialistic object, the SEE is sentimental only in terms of how it affects what he is currently striving for. For example, SEE would not see much point in being in the middle of the nowhere by himself with lots of gold and other showy yet useless objects. These things might only be important to him in regards to how they make other people think about him, or how it would indicate his status.</p>
<p>With extroverted sensing as his base, the SEE would much prefers to be a “go getter,” out doing things as opposed to thinking about what he could be doing.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="fi-introverted-ethics">
<h3>2. Fi Introverted Ethics<a class="headerlink" href="#fi-introverted-ethics" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>An SEE usually knows exactly how to make other people feel a certain way. This ability increases its power dramatically the more time he spends with a person. He can offer genuine, believable praise to an individual he wants to reward, and likewise can make a person very upset and/or ashamed in themselves. However, if an offender changes their ways in favor of the SEEs point of view, the SEE will be quick to reward the offender with praise, and appreciation, treating them like a good friend. Moral ground to an SEE completely depends on the situation and is anything but set in stone (hence the creative function).</p>
<p>“Fake niceness” rarely fools an SEE. The SEE can easily tell whether a person is being genuine or just selfishly trying to fulfill their own needs.</p>
<p>The SEE can easily create sentiments of closeness and kinship, only to completely change these sentiments down the road. An SEE could be hanging out with a person (A) and act like the person’s best friend, yet talk with another friend (B) and show sentiments of extreme distaste towards person ‘A’ in order to gain acceptance with ‘B’. Sometimes if person ‘A’ and ‘B’ are together at a social function, the SEE will either have to pick sides or can treat both relations with acceptance and feelings of kinship. This can cause quite a bit of confusion in regards to the SEE’s “true loyalties.” The SEE prefers to maintain the respect and appreciation of his relations if at all possible. He knows that if he has an ally in many different groups, it will be harder for his enemies in said groups to act against him for fear of retribution from his other allies.</p>
<p>An SEE has the ability show up in a group of strangers and act like a long lost friend, gaining acceptance and trust of the group very quickly. He can quickly charm this group with his well-bred manners, genuine displays of like/dislike, and sometimes risky humor. When the SEE leaves, he can find out through his inside sources that he was the “talk of the town” after he left, much to the delight of the SEE.</p>

<h2>Super-Ego Block<a class="headerlink" href="#super-ego-block" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<div class="section" id="ne-extraverted-intuition">
<h3>3. Ne Extraverted Intuition<a class="headerlink" href="#ne-extraverted-intuition" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>SEE much prefers physical, tangible goals as opposed to abstract ideas. He appreciates those who are good at thinking about things to do, new ways to do things, and especially a unique activities to draw people together. However, the SEE does not hold these abilities in high regard in and of themselves, but only to the degree to which these ideas and strategies can be implemented to serve his ego block.</p>
<p>Distress associated with this function accounts for the SEE’s preference to have his pursuits be visible, close, available, and within the reach of his influence. An SEE prefers to get the things he wants immediately and without compromose using his talents of willpower and interpersonal influence. An SEE finds it difficult to give up on a goal unless clear victory or defeat is at hand. He usually will not give up on a friendship, goal, or romantic relationship until he knows beyond a shadow of a doubt (preferably through “in person” experience) that there is no way possible to resurrect the situation in face of his losses.</p>
<p>Not much value is placed on simply “getting your feet wet,” starting new projects, or trying new things just “for the sake of it.” He much more prefers to think in terms of the long term gains of his actions.</p>
<p>When it comes to achieving a goal, the SEE prefers to be equipped for to deal with any problems that might arise and handle them as they come. This is much more natural to him than planning for and expecting specific possible difficulties or outcomes. This is based in the SEE’s “try it out, do your best, and hope for the best” outlook on things.</p>
<p>SEEs are generally cautious and mistrustful of new ideas and behavior styles that they have not seen, heard of, or experienced before. When people act in strange, unseen ways, they often don’t know what the person’s true intentions are and may suspect that the other person is trying to trick them or play a joke on them. SEEs need to see how other people react to the person and his new information, views, or behavior in order to make a proper assessment.</p>
<p>SEE can become very upset when people are late for unclear reasons and behave in other independent and unpredictable ways. This gives them the feeling of hanging in the air and general uncertainty about the future. Being action oriented people, this is difficult to bear.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ti-introverted-logic">
<h3>4. Ti Introverted Logic<a class="headerlink" href="#ti-introverted-logic" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The SEE hates when other people infer or remind him that he’s not doing what he “should be doing.” This is in complete opposite to his preference of following his whims and doing what he wants when he wants it, with as little structure as possible.</p>
<p>They have trouble focusing on systematic decision making, sometimes leading to occasional large mistakes (e.g. an unnecessary, expensive purchase) that was not thought through. Such mistakes lead to shame, guilt, and disappointment within the SEE, although he does not broadcast these sentiments to many. SEE doesn’t like having to weight out pros and cons or make the “right” or “proper” decision.</p>
<p>In regards to unsubstantiated, theoretical knowledge, the SEE can either accept the unproven parts in good faith, or he’ll completely reject it as foolish, unnecessary, and unimportant.</p>
<p>The SEE can be afraid to make discussion about fields heavy in systematic knowledge, doubting his ability to convey such thoughts in a clear, composed, and valued manner.</p>

<div class="section" id="ni-introverted-intuition">
<h3>5. Ni Introverted Intuition<a class="headerlink" href="#ni-introverted-intuition" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Being as the SEE is more of a day-to-day, moment to moment type of person, they can suffer great difficulty regarding the long term consequences of their actions. People who they respect as having a firm grasp of the unfolding of events are considered very helpful to the SEE. When the SEE brings such a person into their fold, much trouble and wasted time and energy can be avoided due to such foresight, as opposed to the SEEs usual “try everything and see what works” method of solving problems.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="te-extraverted-logic">
<h3>6. Te Extraverted Logic<a class="headerlink" href="#te-extraverted-logic" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The SEE likes to constantly be doing things, but not if they don’t apply to the long term perspective. If it is suggested that something needs to be done to make a situation better, the SEE can implement such suggestion with boundless faith, energy, and enthusiasm if the suggestion comes from a trusted source. Their dual, the ILI, provides much-needed nourishment in this area of knowledge as the ILI strives to make practical, logical understanding of an unfolding situation. SEE gladly considers suggestions or modifications to the methods he proposes to for achieving his goals, especially if such advice comes from a trusted source.</p>

<div class="section" id="si-introverted-sensing">
<h3>7. Si Introverted Sensing<a class="headerlink" href="#si-introverted-sensing" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>SEEs place little emphasis on this function despite having a strong sense of it. They prefer finding a state that is powerful or influential to one that is understated or nuanced. This often leads to an over-the-top attitude that can cause mutual disharmony because of their direct approach. They perceive this function but are unable to do much with regard to it and ignore it.</p>
<p>Knows exactly what is needed for an attractive, comforatable environment and is very good at evaluating this in present environments. If the SEE is “stuck” in a social environment he does not prefer, he can appear to enjoy it and get along with others well for a while, but he will soon become bored and feel a constant nagging in the back of his head to “get the f*** out of here!” In such a situation, he will look for the first excuse possible to exit the situation elegantly and preserve the good will of others towards him.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="fe-extraverted-ethics">
<h3>8. Fe Extraverted Ethics<a class="headerlink" href="#fe-extraverted-ethics" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>When amongst those he holds a superficial relationship with, the SEE is very adept at livening up the mood, energizing others, and getting people excited about something. It usually bores him to do so though, and he would not seek out the company of such people who require this kind of involvement on a regular basis.</p>
<p>There is a tendency for this type not to be phased by intense emotional situations. When others discuss “the horrible tragedy” of things, or lose control of their emotions, crying intensely and feeling sorry for themselves, the SEE realizes that these feelings are just temporary and inconsequential. During these brief periods where a friend is emotionally unstable and unable to take care of themselves, the SEE will tend to the real life aspect of things, keeping their feet on the ground and helping them with basic survival until this period passes.</p>
<p>After the function descriptions, we can add other interesting sections like “typical life problems of LSI and how to deal with them,” “typical sentiments and life philosophy,” etc.</p>
