<h3>Description by V. Meged and A. Ovcharov<a class="headerlink" href="#description-by-v-meged-and-a-ovcharov" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p><strong>Appearance</strong></p>
<p>The intuitive subtype makes an impression of a person somewhat torn away
from reality, internally focused, and at the same time scattered.
Inclined to unexpected contrasts in behavior: shyness and apathy are
suddenly replaced by emotional elation, decisiveness, and activity, the
melancholic look on his face changes to inspired and joyful. Thoughtful
and impulsive, optimistic and suppressed, timid and energetic, he
imparts very varied impressions on others. Internally inconsistent,
vulnerable, easily offended, but hides his problems under a mask of
being carefree. Tries to be friendly with everyone, strives to
understand all people, to favor everyone with his smile. Attentive, soft
and tactful, predisposing towards trust. Willingly delves into the
problems of others, tries to find a way out of difficult position and to
give useful advice. Defends his views emotionally. Can exert
psychological pressure on his opposition. His movements are impulsive,
not well coordinated, and somewhat angular. Gait is fast and a bit
awkward. Chin is often pointed. Gaze is attentive, interrogative or
surprised, penetrating and perceptive.</p>
<p><strong>Character</strong></p>
<p>Very perceptive. Has a good sense for hidden motivations of people.
Especially acutely sees people’s flaws, but tries not to show it to not
offend anyone. Before him it is pointless to pretend. He hates falsity
and hypocrisy. Forgiving towards various human weaknesses. Friendly and
responsive, sympathizes with people, likes giving them advice in
difficult life situations. Always see several varied solutions to the
problem, and suggest a resolution or exit even in the most hopeless
cases. He has the gift of persuasion, uplifts despairing people and
inspires them to overcome the difficulties.</p>
<p>Discerning of people’s abilities. Gravitates towards talented and
extraordinary personalities. Likes new experiences and impressions.
Interested in all that is unusual and mysterious. Curious, reads much
and reflects. This is a creative personality. Analyzes everything -
tries to understand the essence of different phenomena. Feels bored if
he doesn’t find a use for his abilities: from routine his vitality
wanes. Tends to periodically change jobs or his hobbies, to test himself
in a new pursuits, until he finds an occupation that he sincerely
enjoys. He is constantly experimenting, looking for new directions and
approaches in his work. He is very demanding towards himself and towards
others in creative sense. Always can find flaws and faults and is
therefore never completely happy with what has been done. Becoming
inspired by any idea becomes its active supporter. Persistently promotes
and develops it, not sparing his time and efforts.</p>
<p>Has a holistic, global approach to solving problems. Difficulties do not
frighten him, but in the reverse they attract him. When he starts on one
thing, he sees everything that is somehow related to it. Experiences
difficulties in connection this, when there is a need to select the main
important aspects and push aside all those secondary. Tries to finish
the whole load of assignments and chores at once, as a result of which
he overworks himself and loses faith in their own strengths. In such
cases, needs a long rest and to focus his attention on something else.
After this, gets back to work with renewed enthusiasm and completes his
assignments. Cannot stand when he is subjected to a strict work schedule
or when someone tightly manages his activities. Prefers to have
independence that would allow him to live freely, by his own schedule,
and to retain his individuality.</p>
<p>Demonstrates follow-through with his projects and interests others with
them. His faith in success, even in the most hopeless cases, gets passed
on to those around him, while his enthusiasm is able to shake the
confidence of even the most hardened skeptics. Passionately defends his
beliefs. If he is confident in his correctness, exerts strong emotional
pressure on others, disregarding any authorities. Quickly notices weak
spots of his opponent and can easily put him into a dead end. But grows
tired from discussions quickly. Prefers to communicate with like-minded
people, and thus creates a social circle around himself of people who
have similar views and are sympathetic towards each other.</p>
<p>Able to see ahead, has a good sense for future development and prospect
of affairs and relations. Perceives danger ahead of time, and tries to
take measures to eliminate it in advance. Surprises people around him by
his gift of prescience, as his predictions often come true. Having many
options and choices of solutions, experiences difficulty with taking
initiative. Unsure of himself, and especially in his own volitional
qualities. Suffers due to his scatteredness and disorganization, and
inertia of his character. Doesn’t know how to protect his material and
financial interests. However, in extreme situations he is decisive,
determined, cool-headed and discerning, instantly orients, showing
courage and resourcefulness.</p>
<p>Reacts sensitively to rudeness, cruelty, injustice. Can lose his temper
and flare up. Doesn’t always control himself in his words and actions.
Calming down, tries to rectify the situation, especially if he feels
himself in the wrong. Otherwise doesn’t compromise. Very impressionable
and vulnerable. For a long time cannot get out of a stressed state. Even
after many years, remembers what he had lived through and experienced
down to the minutest details. Being disappointed in a person, forever
crosses him out of his life. Not vindictive in little things. Able to
forgive a lot to those whom he loves and respects.</p>
<p>Tries to be responsible and keep his obligations, to not let others
down. Might not keep his word only due to easily getting distracted.
Does not like to make promises if he is not confident that he can
fulfill them. Sometimes does more than what is expected of him. Dislikes
being in debt, having to ask for help, to impose himself or show vested
interests. Strives to keep his appearance, his living space and his
workplace in order, but this comes to him only with great effort.
Impractical and yielding in everyday household matters, modest and
undemanding towards items, but strives to look attractive, sometimes
even extravagant. Doesn’t know how to take care of himself, but is in
big need of both personal and physical comfort. Poorly tolerates
overcrowdeding, large crowds of people, as well as absence of aesthetics
in any of its manifestations.</p>
