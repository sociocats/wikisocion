<h3>Description by V. Meged and A. Ovcharov<a class="headerlink" href="#description-by-v-meged-and-a-ovcharov" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p><strong>Appearance</strong></p>
<p>The logical subtype seems impersonal, business-like, dry and correct in
interaction. May look strict and unapproachable. Not inclined to make
jokes, has a serious and constrained demeanor about him. Usually is not
very talkative, but if his temper runs hot it’s difficult to stop him.
Direct and linear in behavior and conversation. Can be sharp and
categorical in his judgments, due to which accumulates many problems of
ethical nature. At another end of extreme, he may not say anything, but
later build up grudges and hard feelings, and avoid interaction.
Uncompromising and stubborn. Sometimes tries to predispose his
conversation partner towards him by intimate tones in conversation. Does
this if he himself is predisposed towards greater intimacy, or if he
needs some kind of information or service. Mistrustful, secretive and
suspicious. Dislikes talking about feelings. Prefers to engage himself
in something useful, and to bring everything he undertakes to its
completion. Constantly tense, finds it difficult to relax and discharge.
He is predisposed towards sudden flashes of anger. Seems restrained in
his movements.</p>
<p><strong>Character</strong></p>
<p>A realist, who possesses clear logical thinking: he is able to assess
any situation soberly and quickly. Enjoys order in everything. Easily
makes his way through instructions and laws. Respects people who are
competent, and himself strives to keep informed about everything. Relays
information in form of concise, clear expressions, and demands the same
clear and concrete answers from other people. Very pragmatic, evaluates
actions of people not only in terms of their honesty and integrity, but
also of expediency.</p>
<p>Has good management and organizational talents, but lacks in diplomacy
and tact in relationships. Stubborn and inflexible, straightforward and
artless, blunt and categorical in his statements. Because of this, he
has a lot of ethical issues with other people, and few friends. Usually,
he is certain of his own correctness and likes it when others listen to
his advice. Finds it difficult to admit his own mistakes and go for
concessions and compromises, even if this undermines his relationship
with other people.</p>
<p>Capable of clearly assigning responsibilities and strictly and
persistently checking upon their implementation. Doesn’t go easy on
anyone, shows a principled and intransigent attitude in this matter.
Does not act on behalf of feelings, both his own and those of others.
Constantly monitors the discipline and order. Due to his wish to
accomplish more, he is not sufficiently attentive to convenience in the
workplace. Negatively judges the lazy and the fantasists, dislikes
tricksters and cheats. He is distinguished by a strong sense of duty and
an extraordinary capacity for work. Very courageous and hardy. Dislikes
talking about health, considering this to be pusillanimity and weakness.</p>
<p>Very punctual. Values time and does not like to waste it in vain. Tries
to predict the outcome of a proposed project or course of action.
Doesn’t trust new ideas, prefers to not take risks in vain. Quite
conservative in his tastes and habits. If his work is criticized by
incompetent people, he can lose his temper and flare up. Doesn’t
tolerate when he is being hurried or distracted from work. Sometimes,
striving for top quality in his work, and getting bogged down by
details, he does not finish his job on time. Gets very upset over this,
so tries to plan things in advance.</p>
<p>A good financier, who can rationally handle money. Economic,
calculating, and prudent. He likes working with numbers and factual
concrete information. Gravitates towards such areas of activity as
statistics and planning. Loves stability, reliability, and thoroughness
in everything. Prefers quality and practical use of things to their
aesthetics and fashion. A good manager of his own household. Quick and
adept in domestic matters.</p>
<p>Secretive, doesn’t discuss his personal affairs with anyone. By nature
sensitive and vulnerable, but prefers experience his grievances in
silence. However, under certain moods he prefers to express all that has
accumulated. Believes in honest relationships, but poorly understands
the feelings of others, thus he is suspicious and cautious in the
emotional sphere, and afraid of making mistakes. Avoids voicing
compliments and praising others for good work. In his soul, he is
sentimental, but tries to hide it. Finds it difficult to express his
feelings. Considers excess emotions to be tedious and dislikes flattery.
He believes that praises spoil people. His own attitudes he shows not in
words but in actions and deeds. With outsiders he is restrained and
polite, but with people who are close to him he is demanding and shows
authoritativeness. A supporter of a strict upbringing.</p>
