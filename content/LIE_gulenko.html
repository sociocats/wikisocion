<h1>LIE Profile by Gulenko<a class="headerlink" href="#lie-profile-by-gulenko" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<div class="section" id="general-description">
<h2>General description<a class="headerlink" href="#general-description" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The LIE (ENTj) is an enterprising person who can literally “light up”
with what he’s doing. He is given to innovation - takes notice of new
ideas and theories and aims to find them a practical application. Active
and restless, often interested in travel and active types of sport:
hiking, climbing, running. Loves nature, endows it with a special
meaning. Always know what his is aiming for and explains this goal to
those around him.</p>
<p>He boldly experiments, disproving ordinary notions. Not afraid to take
risks, relying on his intuitive foresight to orient in various
situations. Often he is endowed with a rich imagination and is able to
come up with the most unusual ideas. Distinguished by having
intellectual interests in various fields. A good inventor, experimenter,
and technician. Seeks to act in advance, because he knows that tomorrow
will be too late.</p>
<p>Optimistic, possesses a good sense of humor. His jokes, however, are not
always appropriate. Experiences problems with reliability of human
relations. Because of his lack of discernment in making contacts, he can
be pulled into questionable ventures. Restless, talks a lot without
paying attention to lack of time.</p>
<p>Does not assign much importance to order and comfort around him. Nature
usually endows him with health and stamina, which he is committed to
support by various methods. He does not tolerate idle pastime, due to
which he cannot relax even during vacations. He is not very much worried
about the outer appearance, if only his plans and goals do not suffer.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="detailed-description">
<h2>Detailed description<a class="headerlink" href="#detailed-description" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>LIE is very perceptive of positive possibilities of new projects and
undertakings. He knows how to turn things around so that they bring him
tangible benefits. Criticizes those who, from his point of view, are
engaged in useless theories. Adventurous, easily takes off at any
moment. Often takes up dynamic types of sports - running, hiking,
climbing, etc. Not afraid to travel and to change his place of
residence. Bravely forwards objective proposals and presses for their
implementation. If the possibilities of the project have been exhausted,
quickly changes direction and switches to something new. Takes care of
his finances and if he has a sum of money tries to keep it turning over,
playing on the price differences. Tries to concentrate the levers of
material interest in his hands.</p>
<p>LIE intuitively captures the main trends that develop over time. He is
not afraid to take risks, relying on his intuition. He is proactive and
tries to act in advance, because he knows that tomorrow it will be too
late. LIE is usually one of the first people to take advantage of new
technologies and methods of organization. In his thoughts, he is
constantly referencing the past, analyzing past events and drawing
lessons from them for the future. LIE is attempting to find the basic
laws of life and fate by analyzing that has occurred over time. He is
interested in all the unusual and mysterious phenomena. He tries to test
them, to find their rational basis.</p>
<p>An optimist - does not get discouraged under any circumstances. Life
upheavals and stressful events only toughen him and make more confident.
He likes to laugh and entertain people. Enters contact with someone by
involving him with a humorous remark. His humor is often sly and contain
hints and double meanings. Easily enters into arguments and bets,
especially if he is challenged. When arguing his points is often ironic,
ridicules the views of his opponent. His irritability and hot temper may
be unpleasant to others. However, he himself is not perceptive of this
and believes that he is simply exchanging opinions.</p>
<p>Can live and work in conditions of discomfort and lack of amenities.
Nature usually endows him with stamina and good health. Not picky about
food and design of the his living space. Little worried about his
appearance. Has a tendency to wear the same clothing once he has gotten
used to it. Dresses up only when it’s likely to have an impact
concerning his personal or professional relationships. Positively
relates to those who relieve him from having to take care of day-to-day
matters and routine chores. Dislikes those who hide behind their
weakness and poor health. Behaves carelessly, may be frivolous by
nature. A time falls to extreme in relation to bad habits: either he
openly engages and flaunts them, or he actively counters and fights
against them. These extremes apply to his sexual life.</p>
<p>LIE interacts with other people at close psychological distances.
Democratic. Predisposed towards positive attitude and friendliness on
his territory. Feels relaxed in an atmosphere of warm, sincere, soulful
communication. One should settle disagreements with him in an informal
atmosphere, first persuading him of good intentions. He is much in need
of reliable, stable human relations. Due to his inability to immediately
recognize falsity can allow himself to get drawn into poor company and
questionable enterprises. Appreciates reliable, time-tested friends.
Usually aware that he can be too insensitive and inattentive in relation
to others and is wary of this trait in himself. Ruining his relations
with someone searches for methods to make amends. To this end, gives
gifts or shows a particular concern for his partner.</p>
<p>Becomes active in extreme situations. Able to stand up for himself.
Rejects emotional pressuring. He is directed by the desire to direct, to
lead, to achieve his goals using other people to this purpose. However,
he is adept at directing only those who are of the same mind as him. In
moments of emotional uplifts, he feels himself a strong personality,
capable of resolving any problems. However, if he doesn’t find emotional
support, his fighting spirits quickly dwindle. Bold in romantic matters.
Enjoys some measure of competition. Venturesome and persistent if he is
being turned down and resisted. Likes to throw a challenge. A life that
is calm, even, and unemotional makes him soft, clumsy, and ridiculous.</p>
<p>Does not attach much importance to things being orderly around him.
Among the scattered things he will always find what he needs. Monitors
operative discipline and compliance with the projected plans. However,
he is usually not effective in regulating and controlling processes.
Obstinate in his understanding of the situation or problem. Predicts
future development of events too mechanistically, due to which his
optimistic plans often fail. Either usually a supporter of one strict
system, deriving all the possible consequences from this same system,
or, conversely, does not structure information at all, giving in to an
arbitrary, random sequence.</p>
<p>It is difficult to him to tolerate situations where there are no
solutions, hopelessness and futility. Takes up any activity with
enjoyment only when he is confident of its success. Likes to test
himself at various activities. Thus often changes hobbies, profession,
place of work, etc., until he finds what he is looking for. Curious.
Often acts contrary to what is expected of him. He likes to experiment,
to follow the unbeaten path, to fill the role of an inventor or
explorer. Wholly gives himself to his favorite occupation. Vain. If his
abilities are not appreciated, he inclined to put himself in opposition
and contrast with others.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="manner-of-communication">
<h2>Manner of communication<a class="headerlink" href="#manner-of-communication" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The surest sign of LIE’s manner of communication that makes it easy to
notice this sociotype - is the manifestation of sly humor, love of
making jokes, often with sexual undertones (usually for LIE males). The
slyness of LIE’s jokes is due to the fact that they have a certain
ambiguity, double entendre nature to them, and can be interpreted in
various ways. Another side of LIE’s humor is irony. He has a tendency to
ridicule and mock the opinions of his opponent, sometimes even making
fun of and mocking the person rather than his views. May insert replicas
and comments at unexpected moments, by which often he often makes other
people laugh. Easily comes into contact with persons who are of interest
to him. In communication always keeps at close distances. The LIE
considers any ideas or proposals from point of view of their usefulness
and application. Seeks to obtain actual returns. Strives for pragmatism.
Likes to discern, figure out, check everything for himself. Very
distrustful of any kind of mysticism and irrational phenomena:
biofields, karma, telepathy, ufos, etc. Likes to direct and manage,
gives directives and guiding statements indicating what should be done
and when. Calls and appeals to use everything that is the most
forward-going in the given field. American type of businessman.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="features-of-behavior">
<h2>Features of behavior<a class="headerlink" href="#features-of-behavior" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Among the peculiarities of LIE’s behavior notable is his ability to
“light up” with some project or undertaking. When the LIE wants to get
engaged in something, he forgets about everything else. Starts with
small things and switches to something larger - his interest circle is
constantly expanding. Due to his restlessness and curiosity he often
experiments. Gets involved in issues that were taken up by others, but
not resolved. His logic works well when he is in the process of
searching. By his behavior he may exert pressure on other people, be
obtrusive, demand things from them. At times, he is quarrelsome,
demonstrating a willingness to fight when words are not enough for him
to prove his correctness. Distinguished by “cowboy” methods. His actions
at times run ahead of his analysis of the situation (especially true of
<a class="reference internal" href="LIE_subtypes.html"><span class="doc">logical subtype of LIE</span></a>). In a dangerous to his life
situation, he mobilizes all the forces of his body. Very life-loving and
enduring. Men of this type are often interested in trekking, hiking,
climbing, running long distances. Inclined to have some fun, get
involved in various adventures. Behaves himself as a carefree and
careless person. Doesn’t think about the long-term consequences of his
actions. In such moments, doesn’t bother himself with observing moral
and ethical norms.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="appearance">
<h2>Appearance<a class="headerlink" href="#appearance" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Figuring out whether a person belongs to this sociotype can be done by
LIE’s distinctive gait. While walking the LIE slightly “bounces” - rolls
from heel to toe, so that the foot of the leg that is behind ends up
being at a large angle to the ground. However, this feature applies only
to LIEs with enhanced <a class="reference internal" href="LIE_subtypes.html"><span class="doc">logical component</span></a>. The
<a class="reference internal" href="LIE_subtypes.html"><span class="doc">intuitive subtype</span></a> of LIE has no such distinction. The
intuitive subtype of LIE often has a more well-set full figure than the
logical subtype, whose figure is more of a rectangular shape, the
“logical shape”. LIE’s gaze is nimble and agile, his eyes dart around
and rotate back and forth, not stopping on anything for a long time. He
doesn’t like looking into the eyes of another person. Intuitive
detachment occasionally appears in his look: at times he stares to the
side or at the ceiling, intuitively distancing from current events.
LIE’s lips are full and prominent, especially in an the <a class="reference internal" href="LIE_subtypes.html"><span class="doc">intuitive subtype</span></a>. He shows the always ready to appear,
“American-style” wide open smile - the smile of “one of the guys” who is
open to everyone. LIE’s external appearance is often somewhat disheveled
and disharmonious, blatantly unkempt for male representatives. It looks
like this person has just returned from a trip or a campaign. This
manifests stronger for the <a class="reference internal" href="LIE_subtypes.html"><span class="doc">logical subtype</span></a>. In his
dressing style, especially of male representatives, sometimes there are
combinations of items that are incompatible in common sense, such as
sweat pants and a jacket from the suit. There is also a tendency to wear
same clothing for long periods of time.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="as-a-subordinate">
<h2>As a subordinate<a class="headerlink" href="#as-a-subordinate" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<div class="line-block">

business activities. Is able to see whether some undertaking or
enterprise is beneficial and profitable or not. Brings up unusual ways

</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><strong>Problem areas</strong></div>
<div class="line">Not everyone can withstand his saturated daily regime that he is also
inclined to introduces changes to in an arbitrarily manner, by this
imposing his own rhythm to those around him. Usually he is involved in
so many matters that he does not get everywhere in time. Often builds
far-reaching but poorly thought-out plans. Can take excessive and
unjustified risks. Often he is the first to hop onto all the
questionable undertakings. Very talkative, loves to talk and discuss
what he has read and heard. Does not like when his appearance is paid
too close attention, and at the same time can dress rather carelessly.
Impatient by nature, thus can be negligent in details, in filling out
business documents, in any try to work what requires rigor and
thoroughness. Usually has “creative clutter” both at home and at his
workplace. In matters of principle for him is firm and unyielding.
Sometimes allows tactlessness, rude humor. Reluctant to visit doctors.</div>
</div>
<p>From LIE one can not demand and expect:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Balance and measured pace in making decisions;</p></li>
<li><p>Thoroughness in routine tasks;</p></li>
<li><p>Order at home and at his workplace;</p></li>
<li><p>Always a tidy and neat appearance;</p></li>
<li><p>Sense of tact, emotional and psychological intuition.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Recommended types of activity: LIE best realizes himself in innovative
fields that require an open mind and creative approach to business, as
well as ability to adapt theoretical developments to practice. May be a
good inventor and rationalizer. Given the high tempo of his work and
mobility, he is recommended highly dynamic types of work that require
frequent travel and trips. People of this type are usually not afraid of
commercial risk, so they can be trailblazers and pioneers of new
enterprises. They can engage in a variety of work, if it is interesting,
challenging, and does not require special meticulousness.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="as-a-supervisor">
<h2>As a supervisor<a class="headerlink" href="#as-a-supervisor" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A person of type “Entrepreneur” has an open character. A positively
predisposing half-smile is often playing on his face, inviting other
people to a conversation. He easily enters into contract with a person
who has interested him. Given to make jokes and ironic comment.
Cheerful, energetic, and pragmatic person.</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Supervisor-player</div>
<div class="line">Any player tries to express himself in a game, obtaining satisfaction
from the process and achieving some result (winning). This trait is
very significant for supervisor-player, who considers his work in
particular and business life in general to be a kind of a game. He
likes to take risks, but with prior calculation. Not afraid to invest
resources and efforts into innovative enterprises. Focuses on the
future prospects, not expecting immediate returns. Tries to use every
chance so works on many fronts, hoping for a major return in the
future. The driving motivation of such activity is the motive of
acquiring fame as the winner.</div>
</div>
<p>Difficulties that he encounters on his path he takes calmly, as a matter
of fact occurrence. He is a born entrepreneur. Inclined to change a few
professions and occupations within his lifetime. He seeks to work things
out and understand them for himself. Goal-oriented, purposeful and
tireless. Does not respect or accept authority of people who lead their
lives according to the pleasure principle and strive to achieve the
desired results without stress.</p>
<p>LIE does not accumulate money or assets, instead seeks to put them
immediately into action. Better realizes himself as an entrepreneur than
as a consumer. Tries to derive benefit and profit where others do not
see them. Is adept at calculating and seeing free zones in the market
that are open to enterprise. Anticipates emergence of new needs, which
will generate demand in the future and takes advantage of them. In a
bureaucratic society, the activity of this sociotypes faces numerous
obstacles and limitations.</p>

to new ideas and proposals. He is interested in those spheres of
??business where theory connects to practical reality. Inclined to
experiment. Wants to know what happens if one takes a non-standard step.
Organizes his experiments in such a way as to detect conflicts,
contrasting differences, alternative lines of development. Contrasts the
results of the experiment with the accepted notions.</p>
<p>LIE is able to take risks, relying on his intuitive foresight of the
outcome. Despite the fact that most of his investments fall through and
don’t earn any returns, he is sure that some of their share would be
aimed at the growth industry in the future and will repay the invested
capital. Is able to dramatically change his direction of approaching his
target, which makes him unpredictable for his competitors.</p>
<p>He does not like to waste his time and idle pastimes. Acutely feels and
regrets every missed opportunity. Can effectively live and work only
when he is on the move and constantly updated. Enemy of stagnation and
conservatism. His type of behavior is not received positively by
everyone, because it breaks the established rhythm and order of things.
LIE does not adjust to anybody. His pace of life can be endured only by
a person who does not lose self-control under any circumstances.</p>

<p>The incentive for this sociotype is the striving for uniqueness. His
work should provide opportunities to be creative, to experiment and
innovate. LIEs also love to learn everything that sooner or later may
prove to be helpful to his project. Therefore, if you often send him to
seminars, workshops, conferences, training courses and retraining, he
will be satisfied and interested in his work. In working with
representatives of this type, one should take into account their lack of
love for the careful, routine work. Try to exclude it from the scope of
his duties, as well as any work related to the painstaking filling out
of the documents. In listening to risky proposals of LIE, one should
exercise some caution and clarify whether there are sufficient resources
in place for such activities and who will finance them. It is a good
idea to also ask what kind of people are supporting him (often his
entire “team” is he himself). If he urges you to act immediately,
otherwise it will be too late - pay attention to this, because LIE has
good sense for timeliness of action. However, act basing on the
principle “measure seven times, cut once” as often the business activity
of LIE is so large that can grow into pointless fussiness. People of
this type tend to do a little bit more than what was expected of them,
involving all those around him into a feverish hustle. If he gets
excited, showing impatience and intolerance of those who work slower,
this should be taken calmly and smoothly, in friendly manner showing
understanding and support for his difficulties. And if you are also
going to assist his endeavors, at the same time keeping him away from
overly risky expenditures and actions, your productive interaction is
guaranteed.</p>

<h2>Recommendations for self-improvement<a class="headerlink" href="#recommendations-for-self-improvement" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Your forte is active entrepreneurship. You start on a new venture or
project with much enthusiasm, not sparing your efforts in achieving
results.</p>
<p>You are a person of practical and pragmatic bent who knows how to direct
and orient any theory or idea to practical use. You take an active part
in the implementation of new technologies into life. You do not waste
your time on minor things. You are particularly attracted to large scale
goals and projects.</p>
<p>You can be called a person action, since you do not put off the
implementation of your decisions for too long. You quickly and without
delays assimilate into a new job or project and try to bring it to
fruition. You are an optimist who believes in the success of any venture
that you have started. You willingly share your plans with others, enjoy
to try yourself in various spheres of activity, freely take risks, and
readily overcome any difficulties.</p>
<p>You are often faced by problems of organizing your everyday life. Often
you don’t have enough time for vacations and leisure time. Despite your
commitment to a healthy lifestyle, you do not take care of your health
in a regular manner. Try to combine business with pleasure and not
concentrate excessively on a single task.</p>
<p>Observe a rational rhythm of life, combining business with pleasure.
Engage in running or other active types of sport. Be more attentive to
your appearance. Do not ignore opinions that others voice about you. Pay
more attention to your domestic affairs. More often show care for your
family, devote more of your personal time to them, make pleasant
surprises for them, and try to delve into their problems.</p>
<p>Try to cultivate an aesthetic taste in yourself. Do not sacrifice your
appearance even in the name of your projects and goals, which to you
seem more important. Do not engage in extravagant antics. Try to be more
sensitive when it comes to intimate topics - don’t try to draw attention
to yourself in this manner: others can misunderstand you. Unwittingly
you can break the relaxed atmosphere of communication, placing yourself
and your friends into an awkward position.</p>
<p>Your other problem lies in ambiguous humor and jokes that can not always
be correctly interpreted and understood. Be tactful and modest in your
statements. Do not seek to lift the mood of the people at any cost.
Remember that not everyone likes the joking tone, and more so - irony
and ridicule. Avoid excessive emotional familiarity in communication.
Develop in yourself politeness and good manners. This will boost your
self-esteem and instill greater level of respect that others have for
you.</p>
<p>Don’t seek confrontation over issues that are non-existent, unneeded and
irrelevant. Through this you can lose respect of many people. Don’t show
your emotions too quickly. Don’t let your actions run ahead of your
thoughts. It is better to move away from the object of your irritation,
and after some time, when you have clamed down and thought things
thoroughly, express your decisions and opinions at the next meeting.</p>
