<span id="ile-weisband"></span><h2>ILE (Don Quixote)<a class="headerlink" href="#ile-don-quixote" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">ILE - ENTp (Ne,Ti)</div>
<div class="line">Don Quixote - a hero or the world’s most famous literary work (author: Miguel Cervantes, Spain).</div>
</div>
<p>1. Two birds in the bush [he often chooses this option instead of one in
his hand]. He is a genius at finding new opportunities and
possibilities. What he has completed always seems to him less important
compared to the dawning perspectives which are irresistible an
inexhaustible. Scientists of this type tend to procrastinate with the
publishing of the results of their research, thinking that the greatest
discoveries are still ahead. He lives for the future; meanwhile being
not acknowledged does not intimidate him. He chooses to do what is
interesting rather than what is lucrative.</p>
<p>2. Recharge. He needs to feel emotional enthusiasm and ardor, and thus
needs permanent sensory and emotional “recharge”. He is unable to supply
it himself, so he depends a lot on his surrounding. If nobody feeds him
with impressions and positive emotions (nobody can do it as well as his
dual The Mediator)  he mopes about life, loses ability to work and
taste for life. To compensate for the absence of his dual he begins to
mix with a lot of friends, becomes active in social projects, starts up
clubs or scientific schools (Sigmund Freud, a representative of this
type, invented the concept of sublimation to explain this fact).</p>
<p>3. A leader. He is a good organizer because he remarks potential
possibilities in people and situations. If he is to wield power, he
needs justification for it: why he must take that position, e.g. a
critical situation that nobody else can deal with, assignment from the
top. When he takes power, he begins to analyze the needs of his
subordinates, tries to provide them with everything and only then makes
the necessary demands on them.</p>
<p>4. A servant. His dependence on the emotional ambiance of others
produces an effect of extreme compliance in minor and routine things.
Having freed himself thus from having to pay attention to such
unpleasant things, he switches for his favorite activity  figuring out
the essence of things and phenomena. He does not differentiate people
into us and them, tries to be equally polite to everybody.</p>
<p>5. Undifferentiated feeling. He believes that all people in their
essence are kind and love one another. Therefore he looks funny enough
when the situation requires initiative in expressing feelings  they are
not his line at all.</p>
<p>6. Danger. Critical situations pep him up as much as good others
emotions. The more emotions and panic there is around him, the more
active and assertive he becomes. It is impossible to intimidate him  an
attempt to do so produces just the opposite outcome. He willingly takes
responsibility in critical situations; however, in peaceful and quiet
conditions he starts to doubt his right to occupy a responsible
position, gets frustrated by the competition and leaves.</p>
<p>7. Liberty of communication. He likes familiarity in communication,
however, does not show initiative in this, but awaits it from others.</p>

<div class="section" id="sei-dumas">
<span id="sei-weisband"></span><h2>SEI (Dumas)<a class="headerlink" href="#sei-dumas" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">SEI - ISFp (Si,Fe)</div>
<div class="line">Alexandre Dumas Sr. - the French writer.</div>
</div>
<p>1. He is amicable, always appears optimistic and in a good spirits. He
does not impose his will on others, hiding his real feelings. He is
always equally warm, caring, smiling. He does not like to ask and
moreover to demand favors, and strives to satisfy his needs through his
own efforts.</p>
<p>2. He appreciates all the facets of life, finely experiences nature and
the arts. He is capable of remembering and reproducing emotions once
experienced. Ayvazovsky painted his seascapes in a room with dark red
walls and windows looking out in the opposite direction of the sea. He
loves pleasures and knows how to bestow them  an artist in loving.</p>
<p>3. Attentive and considerate. Tries not to infringe on others comfort.
His very quick and consciously controlled emotional reactions aim to
test or alter the emotions of the others. This results in many jokes
if they are out of turn he immediately takes them back. He is
permanently in the process of emotional creativity, searching for the
most effective ways to activate his partner. With exceptional ardor he
manipulates the moods of his friends and relatives.</p>
<p>4. Peacemaker. He dislikes to quarrel, say no, break undesired
acquaintances  this is why he avoids sticky people. He needs a partner,
who under certain circumstances will also not quarrel, but just slam the
door and leave. This is just how his dual, Don Quixote, will act. Its
noteworthy that Alexander Dumas (the great French novelist) picked Ida
Ferrier out of the many of his mistresses, because she kept him at a
longer leash than the others.</p>
<p>5. Who needs what? He remarks peoples needs, what motivates them,
enjoys persuading everyone and winning them over to his side. But he
needs his dual in order to know, whom he must convince and of what,
because his dual possesses insights into potential capabilities of
people, ideas, and undertakings.</p>
<p>6. He does not like to make people aware of his existence while there is
no need of him. He strives neither to stand out as an advanced man nor
to lag too far behind. He does not like to compete, shows initiative
only on his own territory. He prefers that in his family initiative
and responsibility belong to his partner, even if he is the one to carry
everything out. An interesting fact: before Alexander Dumas The Father
began writing “The Three Musketeers”, “The Count of Monte-Cristo” and
many other books, his secret co-author Max wrote their drafts.</p>
<p>7. “A tender calf is nursed by two cows.” When he feels lousy, he is
compelled to hide somewhere and recuperate. His mood is spoiled making
him incapable of manipulating people, without this communication seems
meaningless to him.</p>

<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">ESE - ESFj (Fe,Si)</div>
<div class="line">Victor Hugo - the famous French writer.</div>
</div>
<p>1. Ardent. He has a wide spectrum of powerful emotions. He is capable of
staying true to the vision of his youth throughout his whole life (Henry
Schliemann still in his childhood decided to excavate the city of Troy;
to achieve his dream he had to get an education, in spite of his
poverty, and to get rich). An admirer of the arts as a source of
pleasure. He creates his mood by himself and knows how to make it
contagious for others. Emotionally fine, kind, compassionate.</p>
<p>2 Untiring. Always active, he is ever mixing with people, rushing to and
from. He can easily switch from one task to another. He works very
diligently. He does not prefer one errand to another, all should be
accomplished whether interesting or not. This is not something to be
discussed or analyzed; simply the work must be completed. He appears
very self-assured and self-satisfied, as if succeeding without effort in
all endeavors. It seems like he acts promptly and gets good results.
However, he himself might not see it that way, so he greatly appreciates
sincere compliments for his work.</p>
<p>3. My home is your home. Hugo is a pleasant interlocutor and a very
attentive listener. He can pick the right key to any person. He joys
himself in making others happy. Revels in table talks and all sorts of
merriment. All his considerate attention is for his guest. He is capable
of understanding other people, admire them, approve of their deeds, and
express compassion. He trusts people, is distant from envy taking
pleasure in the successes of others. He accurately detects their flaws
and makes fun of them, without any intent to insult the person.</p>
<p>4. Traditionalist. He does not seek or like new solutions preferring
older, time-tested methods. To solve the most intricate problems it is
necessary for him to work alone, he gives too much attention to people
and would be distracted if someone is around. When working among others
he makes a lot of unnecessary movements, as if to disguise what he is
really doing. In this way he draws to work his dual (The Analyst), which
does not tolerate a commanding tone. He loves when people trust his word
and do not demand for him to substantiate what he is saying. He is not
aggressive, but he defends himself very actively. He wont even let his
superiors offend him.</p>
<p>5. Adherent of order. He loves to dress up and takes good care of his
appearance. He cant tolerate any disorder or uncertainty in everything
from his appearance to his garage and cubbyhole. He does not wish to
adapt to the tastes of others. Compliments on his appearance are in vain
he believes he knows better how he looks. He takes not of not just
spiritual qualities of his partner, but physical as well.</p>
<p>6. Relationships in his life. People around him usually respect his
opinion, but try not to communicate with him for too long, it is not
easy to withstand his emotional charge. For the same reason he hasnt
too many close friends. He reaches his goals through his own hard work
and does not hope for the assistance of others. What he values most in
his life is his family. If he had to choose between love and a degree,
he would choose the first, considering it a priority, while viewing
science as a self-indulgence, a pleasurable avocation.</p>

<div class="section" id="lii-robespierre">
<span id="lii-weisband"></span><h2>LII (Robespierre)<a class="headerlink" href="#lii-robespierre" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">LII - INTj (Ti,Ne)</div>
<div class="line">Maximilian Robespierre - the leader of the Great French Revolution (1789 - 1794).</div>
</div>
<p>1. “I think therefore I am”. He is a man of developed logical faculty, a
strong capability for analysis. He knows how to dig to the essence of
things, to reveal their internal structure. A representative of this
personality type, Carl Gustav Jung, drew the underlying basics of the
functional typology used in Socionics. “Providence has created myself
for quiet study work, to which it dedicated all the rapture of my soul”,
said Thomas Jefferson, during whose presidency the territory of the US
has grown nearly double. He considers all situations of life from the
logical viewpoint.</p>
<p>2. “Justice is my trade”. This is a type of a revolutionary or a
political conspirator. In a conflict situation he usually organizes a
committee to punish the offender. He believes that everything in the
world must be logical and consequently just. He is capable of neglecting
his own profit and safety when defending the offended. He sets for
himself very high requirements. Unless somebody else takes care of him,
he can easily drive himself to starvation. Garibaldi, Robespierre,
Dzierzhynski, Jefferson are revolutionaries who devoted themselves to an
idea.</p>
<p>3. Ascetic. He appears extremely uncompromising, often looks down with a
piercing look from under his philosophers forehead. He toughens
himself, training for the cold, starvation, losses and disapproval of
others. The only aspect where he willingly concedes to his partner is
the issue of dressing, taste and routine chores. The necessity to be
responsible for these things irritates him. Usually he even does not
notice the quality of his clothing. He does not tolerate orders. His
dual The Bonvivant, as if being aware of that, involves him into work
not by direct orders but begins to fuss about, to make a lot of
unnecessary movements  then The Analyst gets involved, and the work
goes rapidly, logically and soundly. He himself does not show much
initiative, is reclusive and silent.</p>
<p>4. Somewhat tender and capricious. His self-sacrifice in defending
justice becomes especially mind-boggling, if one knows that he feels
irritated by everything that disturbs silence and the measured way of
his life. He is very concerned about living healthy. Thusly Rene
Descartes “considered health as the principal of mortal goods second to
the Truth”. In his youth he often tends to a cheerful lifestyle with
many friends, games of chance, booze. Later he comes to the conclusion
that all those things are something other than what he really needs. He
is not very ambitious but he does not tolerate when others get ahead of
him in their career, out of the same feeling of justice. He finds
himself in an especially hard situation when having to obey a boss whom
he does not respect.</p>
<p>5. “He has led a happy life who has protected himself well”. He is very
secretive, dislikes uninvited visitors. He sharply reacts to reprimands,
but sometimes hides his irritation under an artificial smile.</p>

<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">SLE - ESTp (Se,Ti)</div>
<div class="line">Georgy Zhukov - Marshal of the Soviet Union, a famous commander during the World War II.</div>
</div>
<p>1. The end result. This is the only thing that interests him. All he
needs to achieve the final result he considers to be his vested
interests. He is a strong-willed, determined person. “If stars shine at
night  then somebody wanted it”. With all his appearance he
demonstrates he is far from being ostentatious, does not care for the
impression he makes with others. I did not understand, please repeat.”
used to say Sergey Korolyov, the mastermind of the Soviet space
technology. Few of Soviet top executives had the guts to ask this from
Beria, the head of the Soviet secret police. All The Legionnaire does is
performed with ardor, passionately and must be brought to its
conclusion. He has the personality of an untamed struggler, who must
come out on top no matter what the cost. “One should not avoid
difficulties! One needs to learn how to overcome them” is his motto.</p>
<p>2. Die Hard. The expression “severe but just” became already trivial
about this sort of persons. Marshal Zhukov was a really tough person,
but only he could say to Stalin: “If you believe that the Head of the
Chief Headquarters is capable only of talking gibberish, then he has no
reason to be here. I ask you to relieve me of my rank as the Head of the
Chief Headquarters and to send to the front”. He has no back thoughts
about his right to manage other people. Even taking into account his
love to collegial discussion of issues, he always reserves the last
sentence for himself. This is usually compensated by profound passion
for his cause and the ability to seed the same enthusiasm in others.</p>
<p>3. A fine tactician. He quickly grasps the current situation and
distribution of power, makes a decision and acts. He is capable of
political maneuvering but never forgets his line. He possesses powerful
logic function, but this kind of logic is determined and thus biased,
its purpose isnt philosophical speculations but the creative search for
the shortcut to finding a solution. It is easier for him to concede his
logic than his goal.</p>
<p>4. Dispassionate. He seldom gives in to fear, hatred, and other negative
emotions, rarely gets surprised and rarely envies. The more dangerous
the situation, the more self-disciplined and resolute he becomes.</p>
<p>5. He does not like to speak about feelings: this is not his line. And
if by chance such words slip out, he feels as if he betrayed himself. He
is afraid of emotional love, considering it an undeserved luxury. He is
anxious of other feelings as well. Perceiving others to be just like
him, he has no doubt that he may be desired, but he is seldom sure he
can also be loved. He needs his partners emotional support and submits
his emotions to him. However, in practical activity he never tends to
adaptation, but only to dictation.</p>

</div>
<p>1. A somewhat idealistic romanticist. He is a person prone more to
reflection than action. An individualist. He is little concerned with
the present; he is more excited by brilliant perspectives of “bright
cities, which may be built one day”. His emotionality is of a high
enough level, he understands very well the feelings of another and does
not hide his own. But his emotionality is always somewhat restrained in
order to observe the effect it produces. He expresses emotions not when
anothers patience would get exhausted, but when he himself (she
herself) considers it necessary. His way of handling emotions is very
creative: for example, he may consider rage to be ethical, and restraint
non-ethical.</p>
<p>2. Easily infatuated. What makes another stand out for him is
forcefulness, drive, insightfulness, naturally if this force lends
itself to the influence of his emotions. He is very tolerant to people,
understands them and tries to forgive their weaknesses.</p>
<p>3. Tutankhamons smile. His line of defense in extreme conditions is his
skill to demonstrate his attitude toward the situation, to reveal its
comical aspects. So he has a fine sense of humor and possesses a very
characteristic transparent smile, which appears at critical moments. His
smile is warm, warming and exciting. However, his smile is in most cases
caused by inner anxiety; the natural purpose of this smile is to raise
his partners fighting spirit, to stir him up.</p>
<p>4. Elegant. He comes off as steady and upright. He practically never
squints his wide-open eyes. Typically, he is not prone to lower his
arch-shaped eyebrows. Elegance is an every day thing with him, not
something reserved for outings and special occasions. One can seldom see
him in a non-aesthetic pose, his voice intonations are also refined, and
movements are plastic and even rhythmic. In the light of the
aforementioned two things are amazing: he does not care much for the
elegance of others (his dual, The Legionnaire, is emphatically
non-demonstrative); chaos reins in his living quarters; both things and
people which enter his home should find their places by themselves, or
with the help of someone other then the Lyricist.</p>
<p>5. A struggler for the emotional naturalness of people. He feels
responsibility for mood of his friends and relatives, for their vital
tonus. He uses his fine sense of humor to make them laugh, shake them
up. In a company he scans the attendees not in order to find out what
they are wearing, but in order to remark how each is feeling: this is
exactly what he needs to relate to others. In general, he dreams of
bringing harmony into society. History means to him history of the arts.
He strives for beauty, which may be  poetry, arts, even nice trinkets.
He himself strives to be refined. He adores communication with artists,
poets, bohemians, and in general with exotic people.</p>

<div class="line">EIE - ENFj (Fe,Ni)</div>
<div class="line">Hamlet, the Prince of Danemark - the hero of W.Shakespeare’s tragedy.</div>
</div>
<p>1. To be or not to be? A serious person focused on global problems. Sees
the world in dramatic, even tragic colors. Expects all kinds of trouble.
Beethovens four notes  the theme of fate  sound like the theme of his
life. He takes personal problems and addresses them on a global scale.
Meanwhile he often also strives to give something back to mankind.</p>
<p>2. Romantic. Tends to permanent doubts and wavering. Sometimes seems to
people around him to be an irritable, easily excitable individual. For
example any unnecessary movements put him off, because the world as it
is already seems to him too dynamic. Does not like to take initiative.
He values feelings above cold-minded analysis.</p>
<p>3. Strategist. Knows how to time his efforts. Bravely enters a situation
once he had carefully studied it and prepared everything ahead of time.
He waits for the right time to make a move, makes arrangements for any
possible turn of events, anticipates and plans against any problems, and
then acts assertively, without taking a chance. He does not take his job
lightly, feels responsible to complete the project he undertakes.
Struggles for victory at any cost  it is easier for him to suffer
defeat than settle for a compromise. In emergency situations his
redundant caution disappears without any trace.</p>
<p>4. Good vs. evil. He never does things he considers as evil, and is very
intolerable to evil in others. However, his ethical theory is based on
his own principles, without consideration for customs and authority.
Sometimes his views on problems of good and evil are very original. In
any case he consequently acts on them and insistently defends them.</p>
<p>5. Attentive to people. He is sometimes even imposing and demanding,
sympathizes with them, tries to rescue them during hard times. It is not
so easy to get along with him, since he is not lighthearted in his
attitude towards life. More likely he is a good family man/woman. He
expresses his feelings for his partner not so much through material
care, as with dramatic narratives and warnings against possible dangers.
The latter quality is quite important for his dual (The Inspector) who
is not very capable of forecasting future events. You may call him late
at night; to your question “Did I wake you up?” he will reply cheerfully
“You did!” (The Humanist, who also tends to empathize, will nevertheless
reply “Not at all” in a tone of voice that will make you feel ashamed).</p>
<p>6. Unaesthetic in routine. He does not like to take care of routine
chores in presence of others as a rule, in general unable to work while
being watched. If he can, he will send everyone away to run an errand.
He is very fearful that his movements would seem clumsy, unaesthetic.</p>
<p>7. “Proud”. He has a characteristic seemingly arrogant way of carrying
himself. People may get an impression that he is acting, beefing up his
own importance. He is a good leader.</p>

<div class="line">Maxim Gorky - the famous Russian writer.</div>
</div>
<p>1. A consistent adept. He is able to rationally and adequately choose
the best of the available systems or dogmas and to fight for its
implementation uncompromisingly up to the point of impertinence. He
categorically rejects everything that cannot fit into this system, and
perfects it to its ideal state. He is very consistent in the realization
of his system, even when it comprises inconstancy. In this way
Talleyrand succeeded in occupying the highest positions under Bourbons,
the Convent, the Directory, Napoleon, and once again under Bourbons, and
finally died prosperous and rich, which he has always strived for.</p>
<p>2. A sober realist. He never falls into despair or gives in to
illusions; always he is equally stable, calm, and logical. He does not
tend to fantasies and dislikes other peoples passion for hollow
projects.</p>
<p>3. Researcher. He tends to profound analysis of narrow problems,
establishes fastidiously their correlation to what he has previously
learnt. He knows how to listen, sometimes he can listen simultaneously
to two interlocutors. His norm of loneliness is high. He does not read
much, prefers more to reflect  this is his favorite condition. He
always elaborates the accumulated body of knowledge for practical
implementation. To those who do not understand the problem in so many
details as he does, his actions may appear paradoxical and
unpredictable. Often he finds a solution where others are too shy to
find it.</p>
<p>4. A mix of delicacy and adventurism. He is very reclusive and
secretive. He does not like to be the center of attention. In
communication, especially at a distance, he is sympathetic and not
bothersome. At the same time, he needs listeners. He captivates people
by his purposefulness in implementation of his own system. If he
understands something and other people do not, he may fall into
aggression. He is also stubborn and uncompromising, as a manager he
tends to put the screws on. He is tactful, sympathetic to people;
however, he treats them rather like instruments. Personal feelings,
sympathies and antipathies do not distract him; the most important thing
is the result. Ethic is submitted to logic (Stalin). He does not
tolerate, when other people move his belongings  for him this is a
grave insult. For him it is hard to tolerate aggressive people, although
he does not strive to argue with them.</p>
<p>5. Stoic. He is hardy and just, does not spend time for redundant
conveniences. He prefers to hide his real feelings: hunger, fatigue,
pain, and fear  an ill child will not groan, in order not to injure
his mother.</p>
<p>6. Close circle of friends. He does not hide his attraction to other
people, sometimes it may even seem that he intends to show it. He does
not leave unnoticed any person of the opposite sex. However, he can
judge about other peoples feelings only by their external
manifestations: e.g. how people look at him, speak with him. This is why
he can easily mistake his desire to be loved for his partners real
feeling. He is aware of that, and therefore is distrustful and
suspicious.</p>

<div class="line">Napoleon Bonaparte - famous French military and political leader.</div>
<div class="line">Another pseudonym of this type: Caius Julius Caesar - the first Roman Emperor.</div>
</div>
<p>1. Kindness is power. He takes pride in his influence with people, their
love and respect, of his own popularity, gladly leads others. He is
assertive and kinky in expressing his sexuality, but aloof in dealing
with the objective world, mistrustful towards new scientific ideas and
in general towards everything things objective, which he perceives as
too impersonal. He feels much more confident and therefore has a clear
conscience, only in the field of manipulating people.</p>
<p>2. Restless activity, greed for practical actions. He never hides his
feelings  en contraire, he takes special pride in them. It is easy for
him to sound sincere, when he expresses his true feelings. He expresses
his admiration both verbally and with a look in his eyes. He is always
an adherent of love in all its aspects, both carnal and psychological,
if he needs it. Even when a feeling is of a passing nature, he knows
very well what he desires from his lover, has no intention to adapt
only to dictate. He is arrogant, optimistic, before a complicated
situation he does not go shy but tries to resolve it immediately in a
few decisive moves.</p>
<p>3. He pays a lot of attention to the esthetic and order in his
surroundings. Frequently he is the possessor of inborn taste, knows how
to dress well and demands the same from his partners. He is attentive to
physical parameters of his partner. In all his activities he shows a
lot of initiative. However, he lacks a sense of measure: he is ever
unsure that he has done all he could.</p>
<p>4. Less nagging and more living! His life may be poisoned by the demands
of those close to him to think his actions through, to act rationally.
This is too much for him to withstand, such demands only make him want
to act more irrationally, and brush reason aside altogether to spite
everyone. In fact, he acts cleverly and logically until someone starts
to demand of him to do so, i.e. as long as he is respected and
reckoned with. It is useless to dispute his logic: one can influence
him only by challenging him to set aside his goals in favor of other
ones, more noble and harder attainable.</p>
<p>5. Laws are cowards inventions. His initiative and passion for new
undertakings are so great that no criticism, even permanent grumble of
his dual (Balzac, The Critic) who condemns almost each display of
enthusiasm, can spoil his mood. Moreover: criticizing calms him down,
for him it signals that his activities did not pass unnoticed and that
he must have done enough.</p>
<p>6. Disappointment. Due to his initiative and demanding nature he
frequently feels disappointed with his loved ones: they turn out to be
not what they seemed to be, not perceptive enough of his whims. The
bottom line is that he needs a partner who is easy to adapt to without
adapting at all (without changing his own nature). If such a partner is
not nearby, he gets up to mischief in order to draw such a persons
attention.</p>

<div class="section" id="ili-balzac">
<span id="ili-weisband"></span><h2>ILI (Balzac)<a class="headerlink" href="#ili-balzac" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">ILI - INTp (Ni,Te)</div>
<div class="line">Honor de Balzac - the French writer.</div>
</div>
<p>1.”Imagination directs me”. He possesses a powerful, intellectual
imagination. A representative of this type, Honor de Balzac, in his
series of novels, The Human Comedy “painted” the portraits of more than
2000 people who appear hyper real: “he is comparable perhaps only to the
city controller’s office” wrote of him Andre Maurois. Similarly, the
phantasmagoric world of Gabriel Garca Marquez is impressively precise
in every detail. Due to this quality The Critic can forecast the future
quite well. From empirical observations of how a man acts at various
times he creates something like a functional model in his mind. In
general, he tends to know everything in advance. If he did not have to
warn other people about possible dangers (opportunities interest him
less), he most possibly would feel himself redundant.</p>
<p>2. “A priest’s calmness and restraint”. He almost never expresses
emotions and protects from them his family and friends. He sincerely
believes that passions, too strong, will lead one to his doom. Honor de
Balzac has constantly demonstrated throughout his literary works how
passion spreads like a devastating cancer that eats away the souls of
men until it finally suppresses all else. This holds totally true in the
case of his dual (Caesar, The Politician), a hyperactive person that
easily gets carried away.</p>
<p>3. A profound analyst. He is convinced that living is impossible if one
disregards the natural laws that regulate the world. One who ignores
reality is heading for disaster. The Criticist believes that it is
better to be somewhat too cynical then be a hypocrite. Hearing of a
situation, he very soon thoroughly understands it and begins to tell to
the bewildered interlocutor the details and aspects that the latter had
overlooked. His analysis is devoid of any self-encouragement. “You
shouldn’t have a different attitude towards life than you have for the
kitchenthe same amount of stinking odor; if you want to cook a dish,
you’ll have to get your hands dirty, just make sure you’ll be able to
wash the dirt off once you are done; that’s the entire moral of our day
and age.”So speaks Vautrin, a hero of Balzac’s books. Such misanthropy
can kill the anybody’s spirits, except his dual (The Politician)!</p>
<p>4. “First and foremost, he is kind”. In spite of all his “negativism”, he
is really a very kindly person in nature. The above phrase about Honor
de Balzac belongs to George Sand who knew him very well. He likes strong
people who know their way in life, who demand concessions: such people
release him from the necessity to invent goals, while using methods
invented by him (he is a master of inventing methods.) He is capable of
pouring a bucket of cold water out on the head of an enthusiast. But on
the other hand, he is likewise capable of easing one’s despair, when
they are unlucky, when things go the wrong way, when destiny seems to be
hostile.</p>
<p>5. Unapproachable and thus desired. A girl-student by the name of Laima
(The Politician) gave a good description of this type when she tried to
describe the hero of her dreams: “He must be handsome and smart, with
big and sad eyes, not talkative. He does not tell compliments, and by
that he creates an impression of his inapproachability. He is taunted by
myriads of problems, which, in my opinion are nothing to be bothered
with. I am attracted by his sadness, seriousness, so I try to amuse him,
to raise his spirits, to make him happy. If such a boy is present at a
party, I wouldn’t be bored.” This is a vivid description of this
personality type, who is constant in his feelings, does not like
adventures, and desires total dependence of his demanding partner.</p>

<span id="lie-weisband"></span><h2>LIE (Jack London)<a class="headerlink" href="#lie-jack-london" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">LIE - ENTj (Te,Ni)</div>
<div class="line">Jack London - the famous American writer and poet.</div>
</div>
<p>1. “Time does not wait!”. He is untiring in working, science or anything
else that brings objective results in the future. He makes everything
very rapidly, work boils at his hands. Even his gait is very specific,
bouncing, and if he can, he prefers to run. A representative of this
type the great writer Jack London had changed in his life a lot of
occupations: delivery man, worker, prospector, sailor, writer. This was
his self-sacrifice in the name of Art and Success.</p>
<p>2. Romantic. Very often he practices alpinism, tourism (one of Jack
Londons favorite topics was the struggle against the merciless nature).
He is attracted by faraway places; often he is the first who gets drawn
into various dubious undertakings. Often he invents romantic adventures
and believes in them himself. However, these inventions usually have
real prototypes in life. He loves to demonstrate his own courage. Even
the negligence of his appearance is challenging to others sense of
propriety.</p>
<p>3. “An absent-minded professor”. Due to his well-developed abstract
thinking he is not always attentive to his appearance. If he cares of
his dressing himself, he is always bedraggled, this is why he completely
relies upon his partners taste and allows him to take charge of routine problems. For the same reason he does not tolerate when others stare at him (this is why his dual The Guardian often avoids to look directly into his interlocutor’s eyes), just because he, due to his inattention to his surroundings, is uncertain of how he appears to others. He is always insecure about his appearance and somewhat worries about his imaginary plainness. He needs a partner who possesses a well-developed aesthetic feeling, whose taste may be quite reliable; he needs to feel: my partner likes me even in spite of her well-developed, fussy and even pretentious taste.</p>
<p>4. Optimistic. He quickly reacts to everything that brings emotions,
especially positive. He is as if preprogrammed for rising spirits of his
dual (The Guardian) who always looks somewhat scared or angry. He
permanently irradiates friendliness, positive emotions, and smiles. He
tries to make his partner laugh, shakes and hassles her in all possible
ways, until she finally reacts, either positively or negatively,
otherwise he will not have information about his condition (of course,
in this sentence HE and SHE pronouns may be used vice versa). He likes
to relate and to discuss what he has read and heard. It is easy for him
to start up a conversation with a person he has never been familiar
with.</p>
<p>5. Love for life. He searches permanent and constant human relations. He
does not understand very well feelings and attractions of other people;
this is why he is careful in this field and is afraid of being funny. He
much values human life: a woman of this type, if having to choose the
lesser evil, will rather choose to become a single mother than to make
an abortion.</p>

<div class="line">Theodore Albert Hermann Dreiser - the famous American writer.</div>
</div>
<p>1. He easily earns other people’s trust. He is polite, tactful, has fine
esthetical taste and knows how to apply it. He knows for sure who loves
whom, who hates whom, who wants (either what or whom), who influences
whom and why. A moralist, often is distinguished by the sharpness of his
comments. He perfectly remembers both good and evil, and considers it
necessary to “repay” for them. He values friendship very much and does
not forgive treason. However, he is not constant in love before
marriage, because considers impossible to keep on relations that are
exhausted. He does not like those who are incapable of loving. He
regulates relations not as much by words but by voice tone and
expressive look. He does not reveal emotions much, and so appears
cold-blooded. Often he does not look directly into his interlocutor’s
eyes, as though in order not burn him down. A complicated ethical
situation inspires him.</p>
<p>2. “Emotional barrier”. In a new group of people he is usually a quiet,
modest person. He watches and listens in order to understand whether he
can attract people to himself and to his ideal of human relations. If he
cannot, then he keeps on silence or even leaves. Among those whom he
considers friends he is active and talkative. Friends are those who
accept his ethical norms. He submits his emotions to the emotions of the
others: among cheerful people he is cheerful as well, among angry he too
is angry.</p>
<p>3. Enemy must envy. He never reveals his wrath and fury, but remains
emphatically polite and self-satisfied. Only a good friend can see him
bedraggled and not sufficiently careful. He is always “totally buttoned
up”, internally mobilized, extremely intolerant to untidiness and
disorder.</p>
<p>4. Sexual liberties are not for him. He keeps fidelity to his spouse not
for him/her, but for the sake of self-respect. For a woman of this type
a thought that somewhere is a man who “has had” her is unbearable. He
dislikes a lot, when somebody snoops about his talents, potential
capabilities or boasts about own capabilities in front of other people.</p>
<p>5. He lives in the “here and now” and does not like to wait. He prefers
the kinds of work that he can complete quickly and enjoy the result.
While others consider him punctual, he considers himself being always
late. Due dates make him really nervous. This is why The Enterpriser,
his dual, having bought tickets to a theater, will keep it secret until
the last day.</p>
<p>6. He expresses love through actions rather than words; however, he does
not like to invent tasks for himself and in everyday activities gladly
submits to his partner’s will. At any time he can leave one task and
switch to another, if his partner wishes him to. He may even sacrifice
himself for society. For instance, in his family he can bear
responsibility for all everyday material needs, when his partner
performs a socially important position.</p>

</div>
<p>1. An ardent enthusiast. He is a highly spiritual, artistic individual.
The Psychologist quickly resolves any personal problems, always relying
upon his talent for immediate improvisation instead of preparing the
work in advance. He loves situations when new and exciting undertakings
come up, when it is possible to demonstrate his own and others talents;
when one can still expect the most unusual development of events.</p>
<p>2. A Don Juan. He gauges various virtues and talents in the people he
meets and cannot hold back from reporting his observations to them with
great enthusiasm. Often other people mistake his dramatic display of
emotions for his real feelings, which earns him the reputation of a Don
Juan. In fact, he is quite conservative in his feelings, attached to a
close circle of his friends, whose opinions hold great weight for him
and totally determine his mood, behavior, and knowledge. If he really is
a playboy, he does not hide it.</p>
<p>3. Sensitive. His speech is often romantic, his smiles are enticing, but
very often thats as far as it goes. His motto is emotional power over
all and sexual freedom from all.</p>
<p>4. “Modest”. As a rule, he is not ambitious, because he can enjoy the
circle of his friends and the anticipation of something interesting.
Unlike The Politician, who likes to be an obvious ruler of the
situation, he prefers to be its covert ruler. And his influence is
directed first of all towards making other people reveal their skills
and talents.</p>
<p>5. A scientist. He is sensitive about how others evaluate his mental
skills. Often he strives to get a degree in higher learning, achieve
scientific recognition and awards: this gives him the opportunity to
work with a clear conscience (without having to doubt his
qualifications). He is touchy when other people criticize ideas that he
holds dear, or deny him and his friends talents. This is why he prefers
the company of those who share his beliefs.</p>
<p>6. A person of mood. His mood determines everything: plans for the
future, self-estimation, and ideas about the world. Ambitious plans can
change to disappointment and sadness; but interesting news, praise, or
an unexpected interesting opportunity immediately lifts his spirits.
Boredom can even make him ill.</p>
<p>7. Altruistic. He is ready to help other people in solving their
personal problems. The greatest pleasure for him is to find a way out
from the situation that others consider hopeless. He is capable of
demonstrating friendliness and benevolence to all. However, he saves his
real efforts for about whom he is serious, and in this case he does much
more than people ever expect from him and more than he himself promises.</p>
<p>Your dual (psychologically complementary type): Gabin, The Craftsman
(sensory-logical introvert).</p>

<div class="line">Jean Gabin - the French movie actor.</div>
</div>
<p>1. An iceberg in the ocean. He is obstinate, reclusive, almost always
equally cold and enigmatic. His movements are quiet, precise, and very
economical: other people often get an impression that his results
disproportionately exceed the efforts invested. He is characterized by
non-ostentatious quiet persistence and reliable accomplishment of
everything he commenced, internal responsibility for deeds and modesty.
Like a typical Briton, he is not ostentatious in his attitude towards
work, as well as not demonstrative in revealing his feelings at all. At
first he may seem to do everything coolly, carelessly. But gradually it
becomes clear that his unhurriedness reflects his general tempo of life:
a combination of relaxation and perfection.</p>
<p>2. Talented laziness. Unlike The Searcher, he will scarcely spend his
energy for futile work. He is a born inventor, but he does not hurry
with the implementation of his ideas, until conditions for maximum
effect will ripen. He is proud of his capability of not doing
unnecessary things; adores comfort and conveniences. When performing
common tasks together with somebody else, everything very easily and
without pressure from his side goes the way he likes. All space
accessible to him is organized ideally for work and rest. He is an
aesthete who completely trusts his taste. He dresses very neatly, with
taste, but as a rule not challenging convention. His skin is sensible:
“a princess on a pea” must have been said about a woman of this type.</p>
<p>3. Reserved richness of emotions. It is his aptitude for hiding emotions
under the mask of inapproachability and coldness that makes them finely
polished and expressive (there are many actors among representatives
of this type, e.g. Vladimir Vyssotsky, Adriano Celentano). He is calm
under any circumstances, but calm in a different manner. He remains cold
and unapproachable when he loves, and does not hurry to trust feelings
of his somewhat frivolous dual (The Psychologist). He is very jealous
and mistrustful: he is horrified that his emotions will be ridiculed. In
dangerous situations he stubbornly fears nothing, approaches the source
of danger very calmly. This is his best move  to go directly towards
the opponent, and the stronger one shall prevail. This is also the main
pose of the actor Jean Gabin - impertinence, non-compliance, internal
correctness and courage. The more lonely he is, the more unapproachable.</p>
<p>4. Goals and methods. Sometimes he may be mistaken for a lazybones and a
chatterbox, especially when being without his dual for long: he speaks a
lot but does nothing, as if waiting for something. In such a situation
he is really waiting: for a scream for help. He will not work without a
goal, and is not capable of inventing goals himself. Only The
Psychologist, the ardent enthusiast, has a key, which starts up the
precise and flawless mechanism of The Craftsman. As a reward The
Craftsman considers the joy he has brought by his labor. He judges about
sincerity of others by voice inflection, which automatically mobilizes
him. Both desire and joy are often best expressed by his dual  The
Psychologist  who is in addition a great specialist of finding talents
and admiring them sincerely. And The Craftsman has to be a favorite, for
he does not tolerate equal rewarding regardless of contribution. Only
sincere feelings expressed by the eyes and intonations can win him over.</p>

<p>1. Rapid, clear, sober mind. He knows how to act in an intelligent and
logical way. His bearing is sporty, facial traits are sharp and coarse,
as if carved from granite, and by this all  covert nervousness, high
internal emotionality. His motto sounds: force, integrity and a sense of
duty. He is a born scout  he collects information using all available
channels until he achieves an absolutely clear picture that provides him
with indemnity to act for sure.</p>
<p>2. “All I do is done well”. One more quotation: “There is a gift which
is always characteristic of great baseball players and teams. This is
onslaught. This is the capability to run more rapidly then one is
required to, to move more quickly than one is required to, to be more
impertinent than one is required to (Ph.Brooks). Initiative is habitual
to him; he is decisive, likes to be the center of attention. He defends
his ideas with guts and fervor. In front of his superiors he is not shy,
even becomes aggressive. He knows that business only then goes perfectly
if the necessary tempo is set from the very beginning. He does not
tolerate procrastination, is an ardent struggler for quality and
thoroughness in all work. A good army officer. Like Thomas Edison, a
representative of this type is capable of working 19.5 hours a day.</p>
<p>3. “Rage is a mighty god of the strong”. He tends to take other people
out of the condition of complacency. He does not speak much about what
is good, considers it self-evident. With his grumbling emotions he
strives to extinguish emotions of others. He believes that redundant
emotions tire people, and this is absolutely true if applied to his dual
(The Humanist). During a conversation he pressures his interlocutor,
even tries to intimidate him, but if people do not fear him, he becomes
courteous and polite. Fury is his line of defense in a situation of
emergency in which he feels otherwise helpless. The aim of his fury is
to mobilize his partner, and when this is achieved, he calms down.</p>
<p>4. Belief in playing fair. He considers obedience to rules to be a
strength trait. He does not tolerate slyness and deviousness, hates
cheaters and dodgy folks. “Political maneuvers may produce a quick
effect, but a truly lasting and tangible results can be reached only
through hard work” (Kim Philby). He likes order. Having bought a new
thing, he will for sure read the manual and only then will switch it on.
The famous traveler Roald Amundsen managed to avoid extreme situations
all his life. “Victory awaits those who keep things orderly, he used to
say, and this is what we call good fortune”. A believer in honest
labour. “If everything seems to be easy, this is an infallible evidence
that the worker is far from being skilled and that the work is above his
competence” (Leonardo Da Vinci).</p>
<p>5. “A reserved force characteristic for military officers”. He looks
well built, has a straight bearing even if he has never served in the
army. He dresses well and elegantly, but does not like to dress to
demonstratively. He wears his clothes very long, and it always looks
permanently fresh, as if unaffected by time. He never buys uncomfortable
shoes, and makes others dress very neatly. An aesthete.</p>

<div class="line">Fedor Dostoyevsky - the famous Russian writer.</div>
</div>
<p>1. Bearer of quiet introspection, hidden sea of feelings. The world of
his feelings is so fine and rich that he does not need verbal
reassurances of someones love for him. Even without words he observes,
who loves whom and how, who needs or doesnt need whom. His most
important capability is his ability to adapt to his partners emotions,
to empathize, release emotional tension, to calm down.</p>
<p>2. He is usually a quiet, amicable man. Being in groups, he prefers to
keep silence and watch, but among his close friends his behavior
switches to the opposite  then one cannot call him too shy, because he
remarks perfectly, how other people treat him, and knows how to improve
their relation to him. Strives to submit other people to his own
understanding of ethical and non-ethical. He never imposes his own
emotions on others, but accompanies, empathizes emotions of his partner.
He demonstrates specific emotional standstill. He is sure that other
people need him to be quiet, calm, tranquil. He strives to be something
like a “compress” other people can apply to their wounds.</p>
<p>3. Cannot refuse if asked to do something. This is why people often
exploit him. He needs such a partner, submitting to whom, he can shield
himself from excessive chores. In relations with people his interests
are narrowed to a certain group, but in the objective world he is
interested by absolutely everything: his intellect and skills are really
omnivorous. He is scarcely capable of evaluating the quality of his work
and time spent to accomplish it. Often he cannot distinguish between a
triviality and what is really important. He knows what he can do but
does not know what he needs to do. He cannot stay aside when other
people are working, and keeps on working when other people already
finished. He dislikes very much being ordered to do something new while
some other things have not been yet done.</p>
<p>4. Critical towards his own beauty (handsomeness), will, energy. He
feels much pain when criticized for these aspects. Compliments on these
aspects are not accepted as ambiguous only when they are expressed
face-to-face, in a mild tone, without emphasis. He needs silent or not
emphasized recognition. He cannot afford being untidy.</p>
<p>5. Deed is the best care. His partner can provide pleasant emotions he
needs from time to time through intelligence, logic, demands, and
ability to protect. One needs to show up for the rendezvous on time,
fulfill promises, be polite, thoughtful, and there is no need in more
proofs of love or further conversations. If the smartest interlocutor
explains his opinion in the form of speculations, instead of short and
resolute formulations, then Dostoyevsky feels permanently dissatisfied
and unhappy of being together with him. And his main requirement to his
partner is: faithfulness. He does not forgive infidelity.</p>
