<h2>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>Business relations</strong> (also known as <strong>look-alike</strong> relations) are
similar to <a class="reference internal" href="identity.html"><span class="doc">identity</span></a> and <a class="reference internal" href="kindred.html"><span class="doc">kindred</span></a> in that
partners have half their functions in common  in this case, all the
even-numbered ones. This provides a certain commonality of methods and
approaches and somewhat similar communication styles. Business partners
rarely have serious problems understanding each other and don’t need
much time to get to know each other and find common ground (or define
their differences). The psychological distance is naturally large enough
that partners do not generally seek to know each other deeply. Rather,
they are content to pal around with the other on a relatively
superficial basis. A change in location or life circumstances is usually
enough to interrupt the friendship.</p>
<p>Business partners do not tend to view each other as serious threats or
competitors. Their preferred spheres of influence, their basic attitudes
and purposes  defined primarily through the <a class="reference internal" href="functions.html#leading-func"><span class="std std-ref">leading
function</span></a>  are very different, diminishing
potential competition. Furthermore, neither partner can easily stimulate
the other’s vulnerable function, meaning that partners can loosen up
around each other. However, the fact that the first function of each
corresponds to the third of the other can make time spent together feel
like a challenge and an effort. Each becomes a bit more like the other
and a bit less like his usual self.</p>

<h2>Descriptions by various authors<a class="headerlink" href="#descriptions-by-various-authors" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>Valentina Meged, Anatoly Ovcharov</strong></p>
<p>These relations are effective when it becomes necessary to organize a
new project, to overcome difficulties, to cope with the extreme
situation or win in a competition. However, things may change if
discussions and theoretical talk start taking precedence over real
actions. In these cases mutual aid is difficult due to partner’s having
different approaches to the same problem. Despite the fact that partners
can properly evaluate each other’s work and are able to understand each
other, they try to impose their own understanding of what is happening
on one another. Such disputes further lead to search for deficiencies in
one’s partner and cooling of these relations. At the same time,
difference in their respective worldviews supports mutual involvement
and interest in one another. These partners can easily reach a
compromise, as well as exchange advice and requests. Common goals and
proactive attitude significantly improve this relationship.</p>
<p><strong>I.D. Vaisband, publications on Socionics</strong></p>
<p>Relations of this kind usually progress smoothly and calmly. Partners
understand each other in the areas of their creative functions, which
adds sincerity, but they don’t know how to help each other and improve
each other’s mood and morale. Business relations develop into rivalries
of respective styles of behavior and promote constant “probing” of your
competitor who doesn’t yield to you in any respect. Business partners
with eagerness seek out weaknesses in each other’s positions. These
relations markedly improve in a mobilized state - partners quickly unite
against a common enemy or a common problem - and worsen in calmer times
when resentments over minor things begin to surface. Business relations
are primarily based on logic. They make people more calculating,
weighting and evaluating everything from a pragmatic point of view. One
logical plan is replaced by another while each partner insists on his
own version. Feelings in business relations are entirely subordinated to
logic of achieving success. Business relations reinforce power wielding
abilities of both partners, making them more competitive, and encourage
ability to realistically assess the balance of power. Business partner
should not take on long-term projects. These relations encourage
achievement of short-term objectives that yield tangible benefits.
Business relationships are built on a balance of force. Unlike the
superego relations, business partners don’t try to maintain this balance
but to disturb it to their favor. Over time partners begin to feel tired
of continuous struggle for authority, leadership and relevance. In
disputes they may not seek to find the truth, but instead probe for the
weaknesses in each other’s position. Business partners seemingly use
similar methods in dealings, but they are oriented towards completely
different ends. Competitive element of these relations increases, which
throws back both of them. After re-evaluating their actions, partners
become close again, but a new leap forward is followed by another
setback. Each believes that the goal set by the other is wrong. In the
later stages of business relationship all desire to be similar to each
other is gone.</p>
<p><strong>O.B. Slinko, “The key to heart - Socionics”</strong></p>
<p>Business partners have the same functions of implementation, so their
methods are alike. Communication in a business pair is always lively and
long-winded. It has undoubted benefit: partners help each other develop
their role-function, orient each other at solving problems, such that
their contact resembles business discussion and cooperation. In dealing
with your business partner, avoid exerting pressure on each other with
your leading functions or communication will turn into an unpleasant
verbal match.</p>
<p><strong>R.K. Sedih, “Informational psychoanalysis”</strong></p>
<p>These relations can be seen approximately as Identity plus Superego
relations. The more developed both people are, the more their interests
coincide - the more comfortable and beneficial these relations will be.
In cases when both partners feel insecure in interaction they can hurt
each other’s weak role functions. This rarely leads to any serious
consequences, however. Due to partial overlap of worldviews, partners
can easily come to a compromise if they so wish. Light friction in
business relations usually does not let these partner get too close.
They maintain a certain distance, and at the same time can be quite
sympathetic and helpful to each other. These relations worsen if
partners give in to their desire to fit the other to own measure.
Experience shows that this should be avoided. Trying to outperform each
other, business partners obtain an opportunity to develop themselves.
These relations can be very beneficial in terms of cooperation as each
can provide his partner with interesting information, helping both of
them to raise their prestige and capability.</p>
<p><strong>Laima Stankevichyute “Intertype relations”</strong></p>
<p>Partners understand each other and are sincere, but can not help each
other in work. After long-term interaction they feel tired. When two
ethical partners meet, they get tired of common emotions, two logical
partners - of concentration and reasons. Ethical partners can then
accuse each other of superficiality and frivolity. Logical partners seem
to stubborn to each other, incapable of communication, and
insufficiently activating.</p>
<p><strong>A.V. Bukalov, G. Boiko, “Why Saddam Hussein made a mistake, or what is
Socionics”</strong></p>
<p>Partners understand each other very well and are usually happy to
interact. But in general, this is a pair of people with very different
goals. It is difficult to hurt your business partner, however, using
first function, you may suddenly put pressure on his role function,
which brings up unpleasant feelings. Close relations of this type are
undesirable. Short psychological distance leads to feeling of irritation
brought about by goals and intentions of the partner. In addition,
overlap of creative functions doesn’t offer full complementarity, for
example, in ILE-SLE pair both are missing on ethical component, thus
their relations can be quite hard.</p>
<p><strong>V.V. Gulenko “Criteria of reciprocity”</strong></p>
<p><em>Cautious monotony</em></p>
<p>Communication is not particularly attractive, but initially there is
interest and respect for your business partner, albeit with a touch of
formality. After a while, you discover that your partner values you
quite lowly not having any reason for it. Responding in kind, you strive
to put him into place, to prove the opposite. Prolonged contact is
tiring, because you have neither the desire nor the energy to somehow
diversify the “gray days”. Over time, reciprocity and sense of
commonality is upset even further.</p>
<p><em>Advice on getting along</em></p>
<p>Since these relations lead to competition and power struggles, to avoid
this, one partner must recognize the other as the stronger or a more
experienced person, as the leader. Discuss the logic of your future
actions, but perform what has been conceived separately as agreed.
Otherwise, major friction may arise as well as the desire to impose your
methods of action.</p>
<p>Discuss the results of your work with your partner, analyze how your day
has went, otherwise mistrust and suspicion may arise. Allegation of
being unethical are forwarded. There may be a desire to annoy one
another. Since these relations are of logical-managerial nature, and
conflicts of interest are inevitable, do not attempt to sort things out,
especially alone. In the event of a conflict try to separate and
understand what had happened. Switch to a different type of activity. In
this case, the leading partner should demonstrate good attitude towards
the one who has taken the back seat, or at least show that nothing has
happened.</p>
<p><strong>V.V. Gulenko, A.V. Molodtsev, “Introduction to socionics”</strong></p>
<p>These are relations of equal partners. It is more accurate to call this
type of relations a partnership rather than a friendship. There are few
barriers in communication here. Partners can tell each other anything.
There is a certain sense of safety in these relations: each partner
feels that the other doesn’t pose a threat. And this is a very welcome
feeling, especially if the person is used to a more hostile environment.
In addition, these relations make roles that the partners play in
society more prominent. Due to this, there is an opportunity to play
“cat and mouse” with each other: intentionally alternating pressure and
relief during conversation. In such conversations one partner always has
an advantage over the other, depending on the theme or topic of a
particular conversation. Within these relations partners may
successfully cooperate in business. However, this is effective only with
matching subtypes - otherwise verbal fun can turn into excessive
pressure. This pressure always comes from a strong function of the
partner and is perceived as a bolt of lightning from a clear sky, but
major disagreements are rare. Typically, partners try to help one
another. In any case, the request for assistance by one partner is
perceived correctly by the other, however, help is not intensive. In
summary, we can say that these relationships have an average degree of
comfort. One doesn’t have anything against such a partner, but at the
same time nothing for his or her either. There is a sense of having a
reasonable minimum, which reflects the satisfaction of communicating
with an equal and not boring partner.</p>
<p><strong>Ekaterina Filatova “Art of understanding yourself and others”</strong></p>
<p>Here second and third functions are equivalent. Therefore, it is
reasonable to expect a smooth, peaceful relationships where these
functions are concerned. Partners can offer help to each other aimed at
the weakest function of the other partner. If there are no common
affairs involving their second and third functions, this can lead to
misunderstandings and even tension.</p>
<p><strong>Eugene Gorenko, Vladimir Tolstikov, “Nature of self”</strong></p>
<p>In presence of common interests, relations between partners can be quite
stable and favorable. If the goals are too different, there will be
confusion and alienation. Interaction at very close distances should be
avoided.</p>
<p><strong>Sergei Ganin</strong></p>
<p><em>Homoverted - Symmetrical - Rhythmical</em></p>
<p>These are relations between equal partners which can be called
acquaintances rather than friends. There are no visual obstacles in the
development of these relations, partners can talk easily almost about
anything. Look-a-like partners do not feel any danger from the other
partner. The strong sides of the partners are different in the such a
way that almost any conversations between them always fall into the area
of the confidence of only one of the partners. Look-a-like partners also
have similar problems which makes them feel rather sympathetic towards
each other instead of being critical of each other’s vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>Understanding between partners is usually good. Collaboration between
them may be very fruitful especially if partners feel a mutual
attraction. When partners lose their feeling of sympathy for each other
through anger or any other reason, they can apply pressure to their
partner’s vulnerabilities. This can sometimes be really unexpected and
unpleasant for both partners.</p>
<p>Arguments in Look-a-like relations are not common practice. The partners
usually try to help each other, or at least feel when their partner
requires some form of assistance. However, in many cases the help is not
effective enough because partners have similar problems. Look-a-like
relations have an average degree of comfort. Partners do not have
anything against each other but also nothing for which to struggle.
These relations can normally bring a feeling of satisfaction from
interaction with an equal and not boring partner.</p>
