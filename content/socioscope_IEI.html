<h2>My Life - did you come to me in my dream?<a class="headerlink" href="#my-life-did-you-come-to-me-in-my-dream" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>About [IEI] it is difficult to tell if only because people of this type
very often know how not only to be, but also to seem. So it has
turned out, what at IEI there is only it, in addition and it should
doubt of own reality sometimes - and whether there is it actually?</p>
<p>Jokes by jokes, and in the view of [IEI] it is sometimes possible to
note uneasiness: they see, notice its associates. The response
deteremines further conduct.</p>
<p>If it sees that they want to associate with it, then instantly it will
be turned to the people by its most winning side, it will shine and
begin to sparkle with emotions. If to it (or to its interests) is not
turned a sufficient attention, then by the now already burning sparks of
offence it will force others finally to consider itself.</p>
<p>With emotions [IEI] rewards and punishes, gives and demands.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="indescribable-dark-blue-gentle">
<h2>Indescribable, dark blue, gentle…<a class="headerlink" href="#indescribable-dark-blue-gentle" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Regardless of their real feelings, he knows how to create the precise
emotional image and attitude which, in his opinion, sounds best in the
given situation. However, what he feels in reality: the inaccessible
secret, which he tries not to let anyone know. But here it is very easy
for him to determine the interlocutor’s mood, to see confusion, fatigue,
offense under the guise of slyness, artificial emotions. It is also not
hard for IEIs - using simple, warm words - to cheer up, calm down, or
reassure someone, or to stir up feelings of combativeness.</p>
<p>Outwardly IEIs appear to be very mild, easy, even lazy people. However,
they almost always experience emotional tension - from joyful - that
excited to anxious - to excited.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="walking-along-the-street-i-will-not-pass-any-event">
<h2>Walking along the street, I will not pass any event<a class="headerlink" href="#walking-along-the-street-i-will-not-pass-any-event" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>[IEI] dearly loves to observe the flow of life. It draw all-all- all
events, that they occur all around: of [vzvizgnuli] before the light
signal of brake - the flown wind it turned leaves - of the window
reached music - it was heard siren - all the remaining people will go
further in its matters not on what turning attention, and only it with
the caught fire eyes will be wrapped up (oh, how it is interesting) on
top of that and in an undertone it [podpoet] to siren.</p>
<p>Sometimes it scolds itself for this curiosity [IEI]; it is more precise,
not for curiosity itself, but for the desire to be coparticipant to all
these events. Is agreeable [podpel] following the siren child, and the
indeed this was already grey respectable man in a strict suit</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="from-that-also-i-am-suffering-that-i-will-not-understand-where-the-fate-of-events-carries-us">
<h2>From that also I am suffering; that I will not understand where the fate of events carries us<a class="headerlink" href="#from-that-also-i-am-suffering-that-i-will-not-understand-where-the-fate-of-events-carries-us" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>But IEIs cannot remain without information about everything that is
happening around them. Indeed this all to it is necessary to know that
precisely it can occur in the near future and good and bad, what danger
or happiness the fate of events can bring. Its force exactly in the
fact that it can foresee misfortune in advance and move aside from its
way so that it the reserve of it as is less as possible.</p>
<p>This is not an exact calculation, this is intuition.</p>
<p>On the contrary, if he is trained from an early age to calculate his
actions in advance, to analyze them and so forth, he will not learn to
do this well, but can lose his innate gift of foresight.</p>
<p>Time for [IEI] - the native element. It can prolong thebeautiful
moment in abundance to take pleasure in it. If grey, dull | boring hours
or days lie ahead, then he can fall out of them, and they will pass
imperceptibly for him.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>As far as today’s life is concerned, I believe that there will be
changes for the better in the near future.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Incidentally, the expressionbright future was devised by some of the
people of this type. No matter how bad the present is, [IEI] will be
disposed to something good that will necessarily happen. [It is
necessary only to wait a little | Just you wait]. Therefore he sees any
significant development as the precursor of long-awaited changes for the
best. With such optimism it is indeed easy to wait out | through times of
turmoil, especially since the actual present [present reality] sometimes
excites him a little less than the future</p>
<p>It is unclear how, but [IEI] can easily escape from [approaching
misfortune | looming catastrophe]. It occurs, that destiny strikes strong
blow there where it just was - another second ago, but some sixth sense
forced it for the half seconds thus far to take a step toward side.
[Often | It is possible], fate strikes a strong blow to where it was just
another moment | second ago, but some sixth sense prompted him to take a
step in this direction [for half a second | half a second before this].
This is like trying to catch the fluff dancing in the air after making a
sharp motion | movement. The stronger the sweep of the hand, the more
elusive it is.</p>
<p>Far more dangerous to [IEI] can be smooth, barely noticeable changes in
the situation. In this case he simply cannot pick up a dangerous trend.
Therefore he does not like it when the situation remains quiet and calm
for too long. So he begins to [stir up water | muddy the waters] and
conducts investigation through the aid of small emotional storm. Once he
has gathered the necessary information - all, now again Sky | the sun.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>I like everything fast.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>In the life of [IEI], the main problem is that it is difficult to
constantly force himself deal with daily, uninteresting matters | affairs
which are purely materialistic. For example, it can be very difficult
for him to adapt to school discipline aimed at obligatory result. He
believes that there is no such thing in life for which we should rush or
change their internal rhythm.</p>
<p>If he does not wish to do something, then it is practically | almost
impossible to persuade him to do so - he will [manage | know how] to
evade | dodge. It is easier to convince his confidence by will decision:
IT IS NECESSARY!</p>
<p>In the matters he can be optional, avoiding to take | assume
responsibility for himself. [IEI] sufficiently strongly strains need
(but where you will disappear?) the supply of material of its own
existence.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>To the ordinary shadows of life it was to be, in its opinion, relate
with the delicate patience of the guest, who, gates house complete of
people, awaits the [zakhlopotavshegosya] owner, huddling and feeding
on the circumstances (Alexander Green, ruby-colored of sail.)</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>In the event of problems that [IEI] cannot (or will not) cope alone, the
most natural | typical reaction is not to hide from it . Anyone [standing
nearby | at hand] may be subjected to his complaints. [IEI] is
subconsciously tuned | adjusted to its dual - emotionally small-receptive
[SLE] - and therefore issues | gives the perceptible charge ofpitiful
emotions. But to the majority of remaining people inhabiting this
planet, such incandescence of passions may seem too excessive. Such
complaints of [IEI] will cause them more distrust, fatigue, irritation
or antipathy toward him, than the sincere desire to help.</p>
<p>He feels very uncomfortable when circumstances require the display of
independent business initiative, to be occupied by individual business,
to be twisted or to earn a living for himself through dull, rigidly
regulated work. But almost any business advice, recommendations, and
furthermore criticism from others can only worsen the situation and
solve nothing. In matters he needs specific | concrete aid | assistance from
others, and is confident in his right to it, [expects it from | forward it
to] them.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="it-is-missing-to-flower-heat">
<h2>It is missing to flower heat<a class="headerlink" href="#it-is-missing-to-flower-heat" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>No, it in no way asserts itself. [IEI] silently (at the worst by
[polunamekami]) will give to understand that the specific difficulties
are experienced are not, not complex, but not in its forces to manage
them - and it will is very dearly from the side of surrounding, such
fascinating people, show it this trifling service it is here now good</p>
<p>Sometimes similar requests be colored into the sufficiently strong
emotions, the type: Oh, however, well that this such, yes you will only
look to this, people good!. However, yes that this is done!!! But were
no matter how given requests, this in no way appears by humiliation,
vice versa. Once again we shall repeat: [IEI] is subconsiously confident
in its right to request in people i. to obtain aid from them . The very
same indeed it shares with them by its glad emotions, optimism, one the
holiday atmosphere is created around itself only by fact of its
existence.</p>
<p>And is happy it must be that person, which [IEI] will allow to worry
about itself!</p>
<p>[IEI] please themselves the strong, men of weight, in which everything
is gripped, for everything it is paid. It checks all its familiar on
this criterion and it is pulled to that, who, in his opinion, here the
strongest. It will willingly give it management of itself, it will obey
it in all matters.</p>
<p>Next to the strong people [IEI] feels itself [zashchishchennee] and it
is more confident. But losers, it counts, in no way they stand that in
order to spend its time on the contact with them. It although is
outwardly unnoticeable, it attentively tracks information about
opportunities and abilities of other people, finding out for itself, who
has more authority and powerful connections.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>I do not love fools and those, who nothing from itself present, but
thinks about itself too much.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>After finding possible powerful patron, [IEI] will attempt to cling
to it by all means, to find to itself a cushy place in its sphere of
influence.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, in the childhood it can reveal strong conformism,
constant readiness to be joined in the voice of majority. In this case
its basic vital rule acquires new sounding - to think as all do, to
act as all do, in nothing not to be separated and not to lag behind
these all. And it turns out that its personality to a great extent is
the product of medium and environment significant for it. It becomes
sufficiently noncritical to the information, which enters from without.
Everything will be true for it, that speak their, which it is inclined
to idealize.</p>
<p>[IEI] is very tactful, it does not love to tell people about their
deficiencies into the eyes. Moreover, it will try to find something good
in the collocutor and will compulsorily say to it about this, after
representing everything in the most advantageous form.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>I try as criticize people as little as possible, to separate or
clearly indicate their deficiencies. Depending on the situation, I
will either correctly say to them about this or generally I will be
silent.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>To unknown people it seemingly immediately clearly issues the credit of
confidence and arrangement to them, moreover is done this so that by its
further actions them it does not be desirable it to disappoint.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="oh-how-interesting">
<h2>Oh, how interesting!<a class="headerlink" href="#oh-how-interesting" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>It knows how to listen to the collocutor very sympathetically, it will
try to help it council or at least by warm word, will express admiration
of its mind and force. With the interest it will listen bragging, it
will be glad to another’s successes.</p>
<p>The degree of its enthusiasm, in general, must not be perceived
seriously. It is better to decrease its time in two or three - so it
will be nearer to the truth.</p>
<p>In the not too benevolent representatives of this type similar
enthusiastic relation to the collocutor it can here be replaced to the
admiration with the opposite sign, as soon as that will fall back to
decent distance.</p>

<p>In the life of an IEI, there are, to a greater or lesser extent,
elements of bohemianism. The IEI derives great pleasure from surrounding
himself with unusual trinkets and pristine gadgets  anything suggestive
of refinement and cultivation  and sometimes, more is expended on such
artifacts than the IEI can actually allow.</p>
<p>He dresses usually with great taste, inconspicuously and elegantly. His
movements are quite graceful; it seems that he does not walk, but
rather, simply glides. He is always confident in his ability to charm
others. Much of his behaviour is unpredictable and spontaneous.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the IEI sees his destiny in sustaining harmony in a world
overloaded by technical progress. Best anything it can make this with
the aid of the skill, this age long game into the immortality.</p>
<p>The IEI tries to be the poet and artist in any matter, to introduce in
it the refinement of its very soul.</p>
