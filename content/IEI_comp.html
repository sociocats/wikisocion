<h3>1. Introverted intuition<a class="headerlink" href="#introverted-intuition" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>IEIs perceive, process, and produce information concerning trends and patterns over time most intensively. They constantly and inadvertently make judgments, assessments, and assumptions about relationships based on what they see as recurring trends from past behavior. They tend to understand the underlying dynamics of situations, people, etc., but may not be able to readily verbalize these insights since they are so internal and conceptual.</p>
<p>The temporal world of the IEI is vivid and complex. IEIs are very imaginative people who tend to be more mystical and dreamy, thus possibly annoying Symbol i.gif-seeking Logical types (LSEs and SLIs), who require practical applications for their ideas. Their gentle demeanor does not cast them as particularly rebellious, but their obscure desires are often a far cry from those of the typical person.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="extroverted-ethics">
<h3>2. Extroverted ethics<a class="headerlink" href="#extroverted-ethics" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>IEIs apply their understanding of trends of behavior over time to observing, analyzing, and influencing people’s moods. They make contact with other people by attempting to influence their emotions positively, which is their way of creating something in themself worthy of being included in interaction.</p>
<p>IEIs are comfortable discussing feelings that arise from interaction between people. They are naturals at guessing who has been offended and approaching the person and helping them to let off steam and make amends with the offender. IEIs are typically quick to take the blame for offenses upon themselves in order to show their acceptance and good will towards the other person, and create good attitudes.</p>
<p>IEIs’ speech and voice usually have a certain dramatic affect and depth of feeling, which influence the emotions in the atmosphere; these feelings can be used to generate elation and boisterous laughter. If IEIs prefer, they can also generate and communicate their feelings of sadness and loss. They are adept at communicating depth of feeling. If things seem too quiet and low-key, they may even generate controversy or conflict to liven things up and get people involved once again in a high-spirited atmosphere.</p>
<p>The IEI will often say something that sounds very deep and heartfelt only to immediately realize the ridiculousness of what they are saying and make light of it. In this way, the IEI does not induce a formal separation between joking and being serious (like their mirror, the EIE), because they are less premeditated in expression in their natural state.</p>

<h3>3. Introverted sensing<a class="headerlink" href="#introverted-sensing" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>IEIs have limited endurance in their awareness of what is going on between sensations and objects in the area around them. They are generally somewhat aware that they are ignoring this area and perceive it as a personal weakness. They will sporadically work on it in order to meet other people’s expectations or achieve something in society. Much of the time, however, they couldn’t care enough to make a concentrated effort, which they find in itself to be tiring and unfulfilling. This often leads to an oscillating cycle of coping methods for competency and total rejection at the onset of exhaustion or criticism.</p>
<p>In these areas IEIs tend to be inflexible and skeptical of outer information, and may become very pedantic about certain things. IEIs will often have extremely picky tastes, and will not try new things when a stimulus that has been enjoyed in the past is available. They tend to be unaware to the sensations that are occurring in their body, and thus try to create a consistent, simple way of dealing with this area to minimize the attention they must give to it. They may enjoy good food, but will typically not know when to stop, or, to the other extreme, may not realize when they are hungry.</p>
<p>It is not infrequent for IEIs to have a messy living space, although this simply may reflect the organizational style they prefer most. They may sporadically organize or try to add style, then tire of it or forget and leave a project half-finished. The state of things is either generally ignored or perceived in some distant part of the mind as a self-depreciating nag.</p>

<h3>4. Extroverted logic<a class="headerlink" href="#extroverted-logic" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>IEIs have limited endurance in awareness concerning methods to achieve their purposes without wasting any energy or producing unwanted side effects. This creates a feeling of frustration and inadequacy. They do not value the importance of this area, and it can lead to painful consequences.</p>
<p>Taking care of intensely detailed work that is required to reach their goals, like managing finance or being pragmatic in business ventures, will exhaust their sense of concentration and they will find it frustrating as they continually encounter mistakes and things they had forgotten about or inadvertently ignored.</p>
<p>IEIs dislike having the details of the process–rote facts and statistics–thrown at them, giving more weight to an intuitive understanding of how the events within the process culminate inevitably in a certain result. They will distrust and dislike bossy people, and will avoid people who will assign them routine work like chores. They will even avoid their friends and family when they expect that they will be assigned such work, and do not enjoy fulfilling daily chores.</p>
<p>They dislike rote routine and do not give much attention to what others may view as the practical aspects of life. They may seem oblivious to objective reality, lost in their “dreams.” This causes them to periodically lose track of their belongings, making them feel rather inadequate. IEIs will be overly stressed or even counter-productive in an atmosphere where speedy organization and efficiency are forced apon them.</p>

<h3>5. Extroverted sensing<a class="headerlink" href="#extroverted-sensing" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>IEIs have little natural or automatic awareness concerning their ability to make use of their willpower or position and exercise their will in opposition to others. Such a task is bothersome and they appreciate someone taking up the role for them and executing it well.</p>
<p>IEIs are awed in the face of someone adept at using their willpower or position and exercising their will in opposition to others. IEIs are drawn to people who exude this self-confidence and personal presence; just being with them is enlivening. These are the people who dream big dreams and are capable of achieving them, who aren’t fazed by the obstacles that so often stand in the IEI’s path.</p>
<p>The IEIs’ own world is one of indecision and hesitation when it comes to taking action and striking out on their own. What best removes this hesitation is when someone else really wants them to do something. The IEI then relies on the other person’s strong desire to mobilize them to action, as if the force of their desire were their own.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="introverted-logic">
<h3>6. Introverted logic<a class="headerlink" href="#introverted-logic" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>IEIs seek help understanding and perceiving objective measurements and correlations between data within a system, but past a certain point such judgment is seen as overkill. IEIs do not tend to store such information themselves, but they appreciate this trait in others. They may doubt their objectivity in such areas of understanding, and desire a partner who is strong and responsive in this function to ensure certainty.</p>
<p>They have a secret desire to truly understand things, but will fall short without an outer reference to keep them on the same page. Without a partner who can provide motivation and logical structural reference, they may slide off the edge of the map, lost in their dreams and out of touch with reality.</p>
<p>IEIs are aware of their own disorganization with logical constructs and can sometimes feel as though they do not know what to do about it. Sometimes a simple routine way of categorizing ideas and their logical correlations can do wonders for IEIs, as long as they still feel independent and free to explore the subject matter creatively.</p>

<h3>7. Extroverted intuition<a class="headerlink" href="#extroverted-intuition" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>An IEI is not as likely to give as much weight to external patterns and connections, mostly because they can easily see the crux of things through their Symbol t.gif. While an Symbol i.gif type may go from point A to point C, and so on, the IEI will quickly observe a situation and gain an underlying understanding that they continually develop until they have reached the essence of things. They are adept at coming up with possibilites regarding situations but consider these thoughts as of lesser importance.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="introverted-ethics">
<h3>8. Introverted ethics<a class="headerlink" href="#introverted-ethics" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>An IEI is adept at understanding his/her own disposition towards others and their own general emotional state. Their primary focus, however, isn’t on what subjective ties they have, but rather, the energy flow that is going on with and around them. The IEI can easily assess the status of a relationship between himself and someone else, but generally only does so if necessary. For the most part, they view static emotional judgments as limiting to the emotional dynamics of a situation. However, they deeply value their close personal bonds with others and will make a large effort to maintain these bonds.</p>
<p>IEIs can get strong physical sensations of their own internal feelings which pressures them into retreating to their personal boundaries. These sensations range from minor head pains to stomach aches and take place especially when they fall behind due to external pressures. When they do withdraw, they can take many hours reflecting over the problems stressing them, and as a result IEIs can remain reclusive. They can even feel like they’re in a nightmare when they cannot resolve the things that are plaguing their minds.</p>
