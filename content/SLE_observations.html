<h2>SLE (ESTp) A Look From The Inside<a class="headerlink" href="#sle-estp-a-look-from-the-inside" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">This short article was written by a female SLE-Ti poster, who went by
simple moniker of “ESTP” on Russian socionics forums. Many on that
forum liked it and found it informative, so I thought it’s worth a
translation (<a class="reference external" href="http://www.socionik.com/thread/11698-0-.html">original
thread</a>).</div>
<div class="line">Note: The author’s subtype is SLE-Ti, therefore everything written in
this article is not as applicable to the experiences of SLE of sensory
subtype (SLE-Se).</div>
</div>
<p><strong>ESTP</strong>: “First let me apologize beforehand: this article was written
in one sitting during a burst of creative inspiration, therefore, if
there are any errors or omissions or if something needs to be added - I
reserve the right to fix this later. Inspired by the article “LSI
Insights”.</p>
<p><strong>Se  our essence.</strong></p>
<p>Frequently profiles for TIM “Zhukov” describe SLEs as pressing, pushing
through, moving ahead by all possible means and methods, by suppressing,
terrorizing, controlling, etc. Maybe this is true, but only at times.</p>
<p>Originally, the concept of “sensing” meant perception of the world
through physical means. We perceive the world in exactly this way:
through our eyes and ears, by our sense of taste and smell. This is why,
allegedly, we take note of (see, hear, feel) many more minute details
than representatives of other TIMs. We are always tuned to the total
perception of reality. Few TIMs are so completely and unconditionally
immersed in the reality as the Se “program” types. That is why if you
want to know the actual state of things, the real situation, ask an
extraverted sensor. You don’t have to believe him or her. You can evoke
any images of reality for yourself. You can hide in your imagination and
conjectures. Still, everything will be as Se “program” type says that it
is. And life will prove it. This is perhaps why Se is also called
“sensing of reality” or “the factual perception of reality”. Such
definition, in my opinion  is quite accurate.</p>
<p>The SLE is almost always controlling the situation, and, moreover,
he/she wants to and strives to control it. The SLE is always a few steps
ahead of others in his/her sense of reality. It is evident that such a
person has little reason to feel panicked. Thus, as a rule, the SLE’s
demeanor is calm and confident, and slightly mocking in a well-wishing
friendly way.</p>
<p>Se is also called “spatial sensing”. This description is also accurate,
imo. I recall someone describing it as follows: “a person with highly
developed extroverted sensing is very perceptive of the space between
the objects”. I’ll add to this that a person with strong Se perceives
this space as a whole. I, personally, don’t have a problem imagining how
the universe is infinite.</p>
<p>Se types exert force on objects with the goal of moving them around in
space. In their perception, the object can be influenced only in space,
which can be accomplished only by physical action, by application of
physical force to it in reality. This is why Se as a function is also
called “sensing of power or force”. IMO this definition is inaccurate
and serves as the source of all the myths about the pressing and
“line-ups” and other nonsense that has nothing to do with TIM SLE.</p>
<p>Se is also often called “volitional sensing” or “sensing of willpower”.
Why?  because will is a desire, only a very strong one. To make things
happen, one needs to have a strong desire to do this; to have the will.
The SLEs possess such will more often than not. Which is why we can be
very stubborn  we can “ram” the same wall for years, and in the end
achieve exactly the result that we wanted. The important thing is to
correctly set one’s goal.</p>
<p>There is one BUT. We will be striving exactly for the result that WE want. To achieve what we want we can ignore and override the wishes and wants of others. Others are often given only three choices:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>To move together with the SLE towards his or her goal.</p></li>
<li><p>To move towards one’s own goal without the SLE.</p></li>
<li><p>To not desire anything on their own. Then the SLE will want/desire for you. And believe me  we have enough will and wants for everyone.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>These three options will always be at your disposal. You can make a
choice at any moment and later change your decision  we won’t obligate
and hold you to anything. If you go with Zhukov, you have the right of
picking the road. You have the right of choosing what to bring, what to
wear, how to get there - anything that would enable you to make the
trip. You can change your mind and leave at any time  and no one will
feel offended. But if the SLE notices at some point that you aren’t
reaching the desired result, then he/she will correct you - calmly,
softly, but firmly. The SLE needs the exact result or no result at all
there are no other options. If you have made the decision to join,
please oblige me and do what you’re being asked to do - or don’t come
along.</p>
<p>The SLE tries not to coerce other people and undermine their will
he/she understands perfectly well that others have their own desires
that can oppose his/her wishes. But in exchange we also ask of others
not to “abuse” our will. We will defend our right to free will at all
costs. We have our will to set goals. We have our stubbornness and
perseverance to achieve those goals. We will also accept the
responsibility if the fault lies with us.</p>
<p>If the SLE wants something, sooner or later everything will be as he or
she wants it. We are stubborn. However, our base function, Se, also
gives us a few bonuses: flexibility in resolving issues, ability to
quickly re-adapt to the demands of the objective reality, to search and
find other new approaches towards achieving our goal.</p>
<p>Another characteristic trait of an SLE  protection of his/her personal
territory. By “personal territory” what is meant is not only our home or
office space - this extends to the interests and people who are close to
us. You can be sure that the SLE won’t allow anyone to trespass on his
“territory”  around SLE you will always have protection. No, he won’t
go around yelling: “Stop! Don’t dare to come in here!” as he wouldn’t
want to offend you. He will quietly close the door. Or he will sit in
silence and scowl, or stand at the doorstep until you realize that you
were not expected here. And shrug his shoulders at all the reasons that
you give him. The SLE will also respect other people’s territory. That
is, I won’t come to someone else’s home and then proceed to tell them
where they should hang their mirror or put the sofa. I consider that
everyone has the right to construct their personal space in a way that
he/she wants it, just like I have the right to do the same. And I
request that others respect that right. But I’m already talking about
the next function</p>
<p><strong>Ti  the function of creative display.</strong></p>
<p>To put it briefly, our structural logic is expressed in the structuring
of space. This is to describe it in very simple terms.</p>
<p>The property that I would like to note first and foremost is a clear
distribution or “hierarchy” of priorities. Such “hierarchy” of
priorities for us exists everywhere  at work, in our family, within our
interests and personal preferences. This allows us not to waste
ourselves on minor things but to identify and work on solving problems
and issues that are most important in the present moment i.e. problems
that occupy top place in our “hierarchy”. Our attention is turned to
more important, global things. In general, we don’t like dealing with
details and feel frustrated and angered if we are forced to do this.</p>
<p>SLEs also enjoy experimenting. If the SLE owns a business, he/she will
observe with interest who is capable and of what. Rarely makes mistakes
in estimating the abilities and qualifications of a person. With
interest will watch how people’s abilities unravel in order to assess
where they should be placed, and often can accurately assess who needs
to be put in which position. Can change his “favorites” according to the
situation (a “favorite” is a candidate for promotion).</p>
<p>Knows his own position perfectly well  for example he won’t go to the
director and tell him where to place Petrov if he himself is employed
there as an office assistant. The SLE recognizes very well what rights
he has and doesn’t have, and what the other people around him are
entitled or not entitled to (all depending on their position). The SLE
is well aware of his/her responsibilities and of the responsibilities of
others. He/she also sees it when somebody is afraid of taking
responsibility, avoids and shirks it.</p>
<p>Concerning the structuring of the space  we try to arrange our
household for maximum convenience for ourselves, which means maximizing
the space available to us. It will be spacious, aesthetically
attractive, and everything needed will be at hand.</p>
<p>The third thing that I would like to mention  we can prove practically
anything in one and the other direction provided that we are
sufficiently well-versed on the subject. Another matter is that we don’t
always feel the need to convince anyone of our opinion. Unless the
question is one of principle, then will be trying to persuade others
until we pass out. The so-called “pressuring” of the SLE manifests
precisely via our logical function  that we can firmly and obstinately
and sometimes even rudely and overly categorically try to convince you
of something that is in some way a matter of principle for us. During
this, we will come up with more and more reasons and arguments, try to
lead you into a trap within your own arguments (that are usually wrong
from SLE’s point of view), ask you uncomfortable questions that you
wouldn’t be able to answer; in short, try by any means possible to
persuade you in our opinion. All arguments and all knowledge of the SLE
will be put forward towards this goal. Luckily for the humanity and SLE
himself there aren’t that that many issues of principle.</p>
<p>The SLE doesn’t enter arguments if he doesn’t possess sufficient amount
of information. In such cases he’ll simply avoid the conversation.
Making him/her discuss topics of which he/she knows nothing about is
practically impossible  the SLE won’t go there realizing perfectly well
that he/she will lose the argument. And the SLE doesn’t like to lose. Of
course, the SLE may argue a little just to keep the conversation going,
feeling bored and not having much else to do  this is understandable.
Most often the SLE enters into an argument for the argument’s sake, not
to achieve anything. To train and hone his or her logic, so that when an
important and serious situation arrives he/she won’t be lost. But
usually he quickly loses interest in any debates  will incite others
then soon disappear.</p>
<p>SLE’s logic is very flexible  and we love demonstrating it. I, for
example, enjoy explaining, clarifying, telling stories, especially if I
know the topic well. Here I feel that I can “show myself off”. Other
people have told me that I am able to explain complicated things in very
simple, easy to understand terms  and I believe that this is true. In
school, my classmates would come to me so that I would explain to them
math, physics, chemistry problems, and some actually got higher grades
… well, those who were actually seeking knowledge, and not to play
around.</p>
<p>Generally, before getting involved in some discussion or dispute, the
SLE will collect all the necessary (and unnecessary) information on the
question that he’d like to respond to. Then he/she will further accrue
information in the process of discussion. Solid sense of reality and
ability to structure are very helpful for filtering the
important/necessary parts from everything else that is minor and
inconsequential.</p>
<p><strong>Ne  trying to not miss an opportunity.</strong></p>
<p>Yes, sometimes we feel afraid. Imagine that. We are afraid of not being
able to foresee something. Despite the fact that in general we can
always adjust to the situation, we are rather wary of the unexpected.</p>
<p>Especially, we don’t trust people. There is a fear that other people may
ruin or destroy something. Thus the SLE feels afraid to rely on others.
Such that nothing bad happens in the future, we go through various
scenarios of how the events may pan out, try to figure everything out in
advance, and prepare just in case any problems arise.</p>
<p>Since our Ne is 2-dimensional, our probability estimates follow the
lines of this anecdote: for a person to enter a room and see a dinosaur
the chance is 1 in a many million  but for Zhukov it is 50/50: either
he will see it or he won’t. And he needs to be prepared for both of
these contingencies. And no, we don’t start panicking and fall into
stupor if something unexpected actually occurs  we’re still extroverts
and irrationals and are able to handle problems as they arise.</p>
<p>The worst case scenario is when some unexpected option was discussed
beforehand but not considered despite SLE’s uneasiness and concern
then he/she will get on everyone’s nerves with the “I told you so!” The
very same thing will occur when the option that the SLE has thought
through very carefully takes place  then he/she will likewise get to
everyone with the “I told you so!”</p>
<p>The SLE cannot promote ideas very well. No, of course he/she can come up
with something, but it usually concerns solution of some very specific,
concrete, real problem, and not ideas and ideals “in general”. The SLE
won’t be able to provide you with multiple answers to the question of
the type: “What sort of business should I start?” He/she will then
inquire: “And what specifically would you like to do?” Or say something
in the spirit of: “It should be something that you like and that you
know how to do well.” The SLE also won’t spread himself thin across
several types of occupations. Not that he is a perfectionist, but if he
is doing something he considers that he needs to do it well. And the
fewer different things that he has to occupy with  the more attention
and time can be devoted to what he’s presently doing.</p>
<p>The SLE lives by the principle: “Don’t miss an opportunity!” If all of a
sudden he suddenly sees some favorable to him/herself opportunity, he
will grab it with a stranglehold, and hold on to it until the very last
moment, until the point when it becomes clear that nothing will come out
of it.</p>
<p>When it comes to people the SLE is not particularly discerning. He/she
of course sees who stands in front of him: a leader or a follower, a
person with dignity or someone who is servile and sycophantic, but
otherwise he/she finds it very difficult to evaluate such qualities in
others such as decency, sincerity, patience, and so on.</p>
<p><strong>Fi  well, why can’t I be good for everyone?</strong></p>
<p>It is precisely because the SLE is not very discerning with people that
he/she finds it quite difficult to find an approach to each person. Thus
he tries to keep friendly to all, to seem agreeable and easy-going, to
not impose his company on anyone, to positively predispose others
towards his person, and to provide maximum freedom for other people in
order to see what they stand for and represent.</p>
<p>The SLE carefully “picks out” his/her own people from the “others”. For
someone to become his or her “own” it takes some time. A single mistake
can throw you back to the starting point.</p>
<p>Doesn’t always realize that a smile on someone’s face and good manners
are not necessarily a measure of this person’s good disposition and
sincerity. Some people smile just “because”. SLE hates this type of
ambiguity. He doesn’t have the resources to track all of the signals of
this type. Thus he/she is easily led on by ethical games  SLE’s
consideration can be won simply by good treatment; he won’t immediately
recognize a trap. But once he sees it, he won’t give the person a second
chance. The SLE can be led on and manipulated by good attitude for a
long time, but not forever. If he catches you on a lie, sees that behind
your smile hides something else besides kindness, then he/she will stop
trusting you out of principle, and then smile however much you wish. But
to demonstrations of good attitude he will usually react positively,
even if it’s coming from a person whom he/she doesn’t like and doesn’t
trust.</p>
<p>In general, the SLE doesn’t know how to keep distance in communication
(distance in ethical sense). Thus, he/she feels worried and anxious
about it. If a person tries to intrude on his territory and at the same
time behaves in a very friendly way, for the SLE it will be difficult to
rebuff them. It feels awkward and somehow uncomfortable to offend a good
person  The SLE knows how to distance only in physical sense  to move,
change place of work, to not pick up the phone, not open the door, cut
off communication, not say anything, not allow someone to enter into his
life.</p>
<p>Similarly, the SLE hates ethical pressuring before which he/she is
practically helpless. Dislikes this vulnerability in him/herself. Tries
to somehow shield and limit himself from such people and situations. The
base function comes to the rescue here and enables the SLE to increase
the spatial (physical) distance.</p>
<p>Has difficulty showing his attitude and relation to other people  can
give gifts, come over to visit and bring presents, but will do this with
some unease, feeling some anxiety concerning being too bothersome or
intrusive or boring, thinking that perhaps he was invited only out of
politeness. Thankful to those who actively demonstrate their own
disposition towards him and show it clearly, so that there is no need to
interpret double-signals. If he feels negatively towards someone, hides
it, not knowing how to correctly express his attitude - fears that he
might be too rude and offensive. Will instead hide, avoid, ignore, talk
in cold and indifferent tone, reduce all contact to a minimum, try not
to take anything of theirs to not feel himself obliged in any way.</p>
<p>Any breakup for the SLE is usually very painful and often unexpected
he/she in general cannot keep track of any deep ethical developments and
progressions. If any complex ethical situation arises at work  this is
already sufficient reasons to think (read: obsess and worry over) “did I
act/behave myself in the correct fashion towards my co-workers?” In some
cases the SLE won’t take sides but still he/she will ponder on the
situation over for a long time. Just as well reflect on it if he/she
expected one thing from a person but that person acted completely
differently.</p>
<p>Tries to understand other people  what moves them, what are the motives
for their actions, and to some extent makes progress with this. Tries
not to give any advice, especially if he/she wasn’t asked. In general,
holds back from making appraisals of personal qualities of people and
tries not to judge, although doesn’t always succeed in this. Tries not
to get personal, and doesn’t tolerate this in relation to himself,
especially from people who are little familiar to him. However, likes
listening to people-related information preferably from someone who is
well discerning in this: who lives where, how they live, who
such-and-such person is, and so on.</p>
<p>Speaks calmly, with sense of appropriateness, and on friendly terms.
Tries to positively predispose people towards him/herself. Watches that
he doesn’t offend anyone inadvertently. Practices tolerance, especially
if the person is dear to him. Tries to be good towards everyone and
doesn’t understand why others don’t always appreciate this  after all,
this is so important for him!</p>
<p><strong>Ni  “I will do the same thing as you”</strong></p>
<p>Generally, Ni, going by Reinin, is the integrity of the internal
situation. Harmony, in short. Ni and Se are like the two sides of the
same coin  Se types protect external space while Ni types protect their
inner space, their inner sense of meaning and contingency. Ni sincerely
believes that everything that comes also goes, and it’s meaningless to
occupy oneself with minor things and details.</p>
<p>If the SLE sees that a person has “withdraw into him/herself” no matter
the reason, then he will view this with understanding. He might not like
it, of course, but the SLE won’t bother the person. If it is so  then
it must be so.</p>
<p>Learns from his dual to solve many of his problems in the same way  to
ignore any external factors and distractions, to close him/herself off,
so that they don’t disturb his inner wholeness, inner harmony.</p>
<p>The SLE doesn’t like it when resolution of some issue is dragged out in
time and keeps getting postponed  all this time he feels himself
uneasy, grows nervous, starts thinking over various options. While he is
anxious like this, he drives everyone else around him crazy. Hates it
when he is unable to do anything about some problem  this undermines
his own inner mental and physical state.</p>
<p>Feels very grateful to the one who can explain to him/her that
everything will be alright, that everything will happen in its due time,
and so on. Very dependent on the calmness of his partner in such cases.
Someone mentioned here that SLEs are easily suggestible by prognoses.
May be so. We are attracted to positive forecasts. And ignore the
negative ones. Negative ones we can imagine ourselves, hence our unease
and restlessness. Instead, make us feel good inside, reassure us and
calm us down. In general I can’t write too much about this function
it’s difficult for me to understand.</p>
<p><strong>Fe  I hate myself for not being able to control this</strong></p>
<p>Emotional, but doesn’t always know what to do with his emotions. Rather,
never exactly knows. Thus, doesn’t show much emotion in general.</p>
<p>Picks up on the emotions of others around him. Feels down himself if
other people are in a depressed and gloomy mood. Noticing that someone
else is upset, feels himself awkward, as if he is to blame. Can absorb
the general mood around him, although doesn’t always notice this
himself. Prefers elevated, upbeat emotional atmosphere around himself,
but doesn’t know how to stir people up. Doesn’t know how to create the
needed emotional background in a group and is glad when someone else
does this for him.</p>
<p>Experiences mood shifts/swings, but doesn’t readily recognize what
caused them, what brought about these changes, and cannot easily direct
and manage them. Periods of good mood and elevated energies are followed
by slumps, periods of apathy and low activity. Poorly tolerates sudden
shouts or screaming and emotional remarks in his address  this can
severely depress him and undermine his performance.</p>
<p>Sometimes the SLE suddenly flares up over some minor thing and then
quickly calms down  though it happens rarely, such flare-ups may be
intense. During this time the SLE cannot control him/herself and may act
out and tell everyone what he/she thinks of them. Believe me, you won’t
hear anything flattering about yourself, so it’s better to not drive the
SLE into this state. During the periods of such “emotional overheating”
the SLE may leave, slam the door, turn off the phone, and in general do
many strange things - behave himself inadequately, in summary.</p>
<p>Usually these “outbursts” don’t happen simply because, but are a result
of some deep emotional processes, some prolonged reflection over some
situation. How long this was going on is usually unclear to others
because the SLE is inclined to keep such deep emotional processes hidden
from others. He/she feels grateful to a partner who is able to resolve
these “outbursts” even before they take place or extinguish them as they
occur. Very few dare to approach the SLE when he/she is in a bad mood.
But the IEI may.</p>
<p>Feels grateful to a partner who withholds emotional commentary in his
address, and who holds himself with some restraint and tact in making
personal and emotional statements, since the SLE easily falls under the
influence of other people’s emotional states.</p>
<p>At the same time, welcomes positive emotions in all their
manifestations. Likes “charging up” through this. Enjoys it when others
direct positive emotions to his person. Enjoys holidays and
celebrations, loves going to the movies to see breathtaking emotional
scenes and to feel more enlivened through such feelings. If the SLE
doesn’t receive this kind of emotional support from his/her partner, if
the partner is cold and closed off, the SLE can try to provoke him or
her  behave defiantly and provocatively, try to antagonize them, mock
and taunt, make jokes in his partner’s address. But does this either
only to people with whom he is very familiar, or when he is bored and
wants to tease somebody.</p>
<p>In general I hate it when I can’t control something. This is why I don’t
like my mood swings and appreciate when there is somebody who is able to
keep things under control in such situations.</p>
<p><strong>Si  is this even important?</strong></p>
<p>Here everything is very simple. SLE’s own sensations are usually
subordinate to some other more important things. For example, health and
sense of well-being are sacrificed to what he has to do that day. The
SLE can work himself senseless, he/she can walk around with a fever and
scrub the floors in his kitchen, show up sick to an appointment which
really could have been canceled.</p>
<p>Then there is the other extreme. If the SLE feels that he is falling
sick, he can pump himself with medicines  how can it be otherwise? He
can’t miss out on a day or two  without him the world will stop! The
consequence of such health experiments can be rather unpredictable.</p>
<p>If the SLE is very sick and cannot make it through “on his feet”, he
will try to conceal this fact from others. I don’t know what kind of an
instinct comes into play here, but when I feel myself unwell and
helpless, I don’t like when others starting coming around with offers of
care and help.</p>
<p>If one of his relatives or close friends falls sick, then the SLE tries
to help by all methods known to him or her. Good thing if he/she doesn’t
know too many of these methods and “cures”, otherwise his sick friends
and relatives would have to run away, since in sensing the SLE doesn’t
feel any limits making any extremes possible.</p>
<p>At home - undemanding, although likes it when everything is set up well,
with beauty and in good taste, and that his living space is spacious and
convenient, such that everything is at hand. Can eat anything, but
prefers food that is savory of course. Doesn’t require delicacies, but
neither will he eat just whatever. Concerning cooking: I don’t cook very
often, but I try to cook well and to always have something prepared
around the house. I will consider the culinary preferences of my family,
and of course won’t forget about myself. And I don’t like any excesses,
not in my home.</p>
<p><strong>Te  obvious in itself.</strong></p>
<p>I don’t concern too much with whether something is expedient. I am aware
of this, of course  any situation is scanned from the point of view of
whether the resources are being used reasonably  but I prefer not to
talk of it. For us it’s obvious as it is.</p>
<p>If I see someone is trying to solve a problem repeatedly by some not
very rational method, I will try to mend the situation. And it won’t
even occur to me to rebuke or ridicule this person. I won’t even pause
and think about how he/she’s so stupid that he couldn’t come up with
some other quicker and more effective way of doing things. Or why
he/she’s stepping on the same rake over and over again. If they continue
to worry about this issue, I will tell them that it’s not worth it and
the problem is really insignificant. If I’m asked of this, will offer
some way of solving it.</p>
<p>Often I’ll try to shield my partner from having to make decisions on
such questions and instead attempt to work through them myself, when I
see that he/she is struggling, lagging behind, and in addition is very
anxious and stressed over it. Many problems can be solved in silence and
on my own, and then I’ll offer the finished result to my partner.
Unfortunately I can’t solve all problems. With many he’ll have to deal
himself, just like I often have to deal with my painful function on my
own.</p>
<p>I’ve witnessed a situation in which an IEI sweated for a weak over a
joke that was made in his address by an LIE. The joke was minor, a
common saying, but apparently he took it personally and was silently
mulling over it for a long time. When he finally told me of it, I told
him that it’s a common phrase and that he shouldn’t worry about it. Even
though I myself wouldn’t have made a joke like that.</p>
<p>At work I will try to optimize the general working process, for
instance, by making tables for some standard forms, etc. I would do it
silently on my own and then present the result to others. If they won’t
adhere to the procedures I won’t criticize  I will put them before the
fact again, and again, however many times it is needed. In extreme
cases, will use some penalty. But I won’t scold or lecture anyone, and
will hear out their objections and alternative suggestions concerning
improvements and further optimization of the work process. In principle,
everything is possible. But everything will be as I want it. One only
needs to want.</p>
<p>And this is how we are. I hope this wasn’t too long.</p>
