<h3>Basic Notion<a class="headerlink" href="#basic-notion" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The model of information metabolism was first presented by K?piski
(1970) and then further developed by him and others. K?piski claimed
that technical models impose a dualistic characterization of human
beingsthus implying that mental processes govern somatic processes
mechanistically and explaining very little about psychological life,
e.g., experiences, creativity. He considered biological models to be
closer to psychological reality than technical ones, because they take
life into consideration.</p>
<p>The term energetic-informational metabolism was used by K?piski
(1970, 1979a) to denote life, or more specifically, two processes
without which life would not be possible. In the initial phases of
phylogenetic development, energy metabolism dominates, but it always
coexists with information metabolism, e.g., processing of information
concerning sources of nourishment. As development progresses,
information metabolism gains greater importance and, in extreme
situations, all available energy is utilized for information processing.
The information-metabolism model is based on an analogy with the
structural organization of the cell, and attempts to describe
information processing as analogous to energy metabolism. According to
K?piski (1970) the metabolism of information (i.e., processing of
information) functions like a cell, i.e., it has its own border,
analogous to the cell membrane; a control center similar to the cellular
nucleus; a system for information distribution and processing, similar
to the endoplasmic reticulum and lysosome; and a source of energy,
similar to the mitochondria. At the basis of the theory lies a need for
information input which varies with time, as is acknowledged by other
theories of information processing. K?piskis view was based on a
generalization of Carnots principle, which states that the organism is
an open system and its negentropy rises or falls as results of processes
described by the laws of life conservation and species conservation,
respectively (Struzik, 1987a, p. 107). These are two principal
biological laws recognized by K?piski. He also describes two phases of
such metabolism. The first phase, which is almost entirely involuntary
and localized in lower parts of the brain (diencephalon and
rhinencephalon), establishes a basic attitude toward or against some
aspects of the environment. The second phase, which is voluntary and
localized in the neocortex, is responsible for active behavior in
relation to the environment.</p>

<h4>Control Center<a class="headerlink" href="#control-center" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Information metabolism occurs within a defined space and time. It has a
control center (CC)i.e., ego or the Iand functional structures
enabling reception, processing, and assimilation of information, as well
as regulation of the organismss own activities. Information metabolism
is determined by the phylogenetic and ontogenetic past of organism, but
it is also involved in pursuing aims which extend into the future. It
creates individually varying pictures (i.e., functional structures) of
the outside world, which although objectively uniform are perceived as
unique and different by each individual.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="functional-structures">
<h4>Functional Structures<a class="headerlink" href="#functional-structures" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The term functional structure is used by K?piski for schematic
representation of perception and activity.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="system-of-values">
<h4>System of Values<a class="headerlink" href="#system-of-values" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Decision-making is recognized as one of the basic features of life; it
has different degrees of freedom in different organismslimited in the
most primitive organisms and a maximum value in humans. The hierarchy of
values governs the mechanisms selecting and filtering the information
reaching any particular decision-making level. This system of values has
three levels (K?piski, 1977b):</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>The first one is biological and is concerned with all that is
described by the concept of biological programming (i.e., all that
man is born with and can control to some extent). It is determined by
two basic biological laws: self and species preservation. Depending
on how well they are established one can speak of greater or lesser
life dynamics of an individual.</p></li>
<li><p>The second level determines an emotional attitude (i.e., towards or
against). It is characterized by the formation of complexes, which
are emotional centers where an individuals emotional relations meet
with the environment. These centers are usually formed around an
important person from childhood and influence a persons emotional
relationships in later life. Complexes can also arise in connection
with traumatic situations and can shape an individuals attitudes
toward similar situations that occur later in life. Complexes become
fixed by repetition. The biological and emotional levels are located
below the threshold of consciousness, meaning they are automatic.
They shape a real hierarchy of values (I am really like this)
based on fixed and automatic tendencies, habits, and attitudes.</p></li>
<li><p>The third level is sociocultural and determines how an individual
projects himself into the future (I would like to be like this,
these are my goals, this seems most important to me). This level is
conscious and consists of an individuals aspirations, ideals, and
cultural models. It refers to the hierarchy of values of ones social
environment.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The real hierarchy of values is more important in the process of
decision-making, but final decisions are determined by all levels of the
system of values, including the ideal hierarchy. Therefore, an
individuals will can control his or her behavior to a certain degree.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="maintaining-order">
<h4>Maintaining Order<a class="headerlink" href="#maintaining-order" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Order is the essence of the structure. The preservation of structure
and order in the metabolism of energy requires no effort, at least no
conscious effort, for this is taken care of by physiological mechanisms.
Their preservation in information metabolism is connected with
continuous efforts focusing on the proper selection of information
coming from the outside and inside of the organism and on the choice of
proper forms of reactions. This integrational effort is largely
unconscious. However, the part that reaches our consciousness is enough
to realize how much effort it requires to keep order in the chaos of
contradictory emotions, ideas, plans and ways of looking at the world
and ourselves, etc. Integrational efforts are conscious when they take
shape in an act of will. Information metabolism is subjectively
experienced as a pressure of sensation coming from the world outside,
which man tries to arrange and sort out under greater or lesser tension
and due to which the world of mans experiences constantly changes its
theme and color (K?piski, 1979a, p. 191), and from the world inside,
which is made up of signals coming from the interoreceptors and mans
own mental activities: dreams, plans, memories, fantasies, thoughts, and
the like.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="autonomic-psychological-activity">
<h4>Autonomic Psychological Activity<a class="headerlink" href="#autonomic-psychological-activity" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Daydreaming is the best example of mans own mental activities.
Daydreaming is something which is most mineone has an absolute power
over it, while having no power over reality. One can only fight for it,
winning or losing in turns. The weaker the possibility of expansion and
the greater the number of limitations to ones own sphere of existence,
the richer and less realistic dreams become. In the conscious state,
however, there are some limits of tolerance to owns fantasies. When
fantasy becomes too fantastic, i.e., when it no longer can fit in the
structure of the real world, it becomes something strange and
surprising, dangerous, and comical. The world of daydreams is reduced
under the pressure of reality; what is unreal is pushed to the margin or
totally disappears from consciousness however, that which does not fit
the structure of the real world occurs in dream visions at night.
Daydreaming () belongs to the same sphere of experiences as thinking,
planning and dream visions in sleep. The limiting influence of the
structure of the real world is much stronger in the first two phenomena
and much weaker in the third. This freedom is much greater in
daydreaming. One is sovereign ruler over ones world of dreams. In the
case of sleep the situation is reversed. It is true that present reality
has hardly any influence on the form and content of ones visions, but,
at the same time, one has no power over them. On the contrary, one
remains in the power of ones visions, from which it is only sometimes
possible to free oneself by waking up an a strong act of will
(K?piski, 1979b, pp. 178181).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="sense-of-reality-and-feedback-between-an-organism-and-environment">
<h4>Sense of Reality and Feedback between an Organism and Environment<a class="headerlink" href="#sense-of-reality-and-feedback-between-an-organism-and-environment" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>One of the rules governing information metabolism says that the world
around is changeable and the organism is stable (K?piski, 1979a). Any
change in the structure of the exchange of signals with the environment
provokes an orientation reflex, which is accompanied by the feeling of
anxiety. The force of the vegetative and emotional reaction to the
outside stimulus depends on the force and the unusualness of the
stimulus and on the present state of consciousness. The reaction is
exceptionally strong when the signaling system is in a state of low
selecting ability (e.g., in sleep), which can be shown as a scale of
values changing with the situation and making one set of signals reach
the organism more easily than another.</p>
<p>The degree of total integration of the functions of mans nervous system
is proportional to the state of consciousness, e.g., aware
responsiveness to the environment. Any break of contact with the
surrounding world causes a relaxation of this integrating process. The
sense of reality is directly dependent on mans sensorial contact with
the environment. In mans sense of reality there is a lot of habit and
belief. Its order is disturbed whenever man faces a new, unusual
situation, when he experiences an accumulation of too many positive or
negative emotions, or when, for a longer period of time, his actions are
influenced by his negative emotional attitude toward the world around
him and to himself. The monotony of such an emotional state makes life
dull, unpleasant, and boring so that its reality becomes blurred. In
sleep reality is made up of dream visions, while in a conscious state it
is made up of the world around. Doubts arise when we consider the border
between sleep and wakefulness. In the state of wakefulness man is in a
strong feedback relationship with his surroundings; the perception
threshold for exteroceptive stimuli is lower and for interoceptive
stimuli it is higher. In sleep, on the other hand, the feedback
relationship with the surroundings is diminished. We can consider the
rhythmicity of sleep and wakefulness as a changing reactivity to
exteroceptive and interoceptive stimuli, changing mans relationship
with the environment.</p>

<h3>A Model of Information Metabolism<a class="headerlink" href="#a-model-of-information-metabolism" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The metaphor of information metabolism expresses the thesis that human
experience and behavior cannot be explained by a technical model of
information processing. This process in humans is influenced to a
significant degree by the subjective meaning of information, which was
shaped during the persons individual life-history. The unique set of
experiences contained in the functional structures of a system of values
includes, especially at the emotional level, subjective emotional
complexes. These complexes cause human behavior in some situations to be
directed by subjective feelings, rather than objective logic. For this
reason the notion of information metabolism in human seems to be more
adequate than that of information processing. The model applied by
K?piski of information metabolism, in its essence, enables us to
differentiate the main elements in the structure of human experiences,
analogous to the structure and functions of biological cell. These are
presented in Figure 2.1:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Central PointI, or control center (CC in the figure). This
structure corresponds to a universal experience of being a subject of
ones own psychical activity, which controls overall ones own
activity, like the nucleus, which governs the biological cell
activity.</p></li>
<li><p>Boundaries (the whole cylinder in the figure), considered in the
sense of self-identity, as a means for enabling discrimination of
ones own limits and differentiating oneself from other people and
from the external world.</p></li>
<li><p>Functional structures shaped in earlier life, which maintain order in
space and time and layers of systems of values. Creation of this
structure may be compared to synthesis of biochemical compounds of a
biological cell.</p></li>
<li><p>Centers of energy necessary for preservation of metabolism or
information, i.e., proper stimuli reception, selection and
integration, as well as decision-making.</p></li>
<li><p>Centers of elimination, where useless and unimportant information is
removed.</p></li>
