<h3>1st Function - Te Extraverted logic<a class="headerlink" href="#st-function-te-extraverted-logic" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>There is no larger misfortune for the LIE than the impossibility of finding a proper application for his own proactive, pragmatic qualities. His entire life is a search for opportunities that would allow him to fully realize his strengths and to apply his acumen and abilities to interesting and promising endeavors.</p>
<p>LIE’s pragmatic qualities manifest depending on the objective possibilities that present themselves with specific conditions and various situations. The LIE does not rely on his own volitional efforts and qualities – this is inexpedient, especially since in life there are still such things as luck, good fortune, and other external circumstances, which create situations where it makes the most sense to apply effort and utilize one’s skills and talents. Under unfavorable circumstances, LIE considers it to be generally senseless to force himself to do anything – it is better to attempt to influence the conditions instead. “Sisyphean labor” is not for him.</p>
<p>Representatives of this type actively advocate for the equally fair conditions and equally broad range of possibilities for everyone. The LIE promotes the restoration of fairness, trying to return that which is rightfully due to him.</p>
<p>If there is no possibility to restore fairness, LIE searches for a new place, where his point of view will be shared, where his work will be appropriately valued. Representatives of this type are involved in continuous search for best conditions and broader possibilities for application for their abilities and talents. Frequent change of professions is characteristic for them, as well as change of their place of residence: things didn’t work out here – they depart for other places, discover new lands, new opportunities. They are “pioneers”. If it was impossible for them to realize themselves in one sphere, they boldly try themselves in another, until finally they find an occupation that satisfies them.</p>
<p>They prefer to attain high efficiency via reasonable and rational distribution of their efforts and energy. For this very reason, representatives of this type don’t have an equal when it comes to development and introduction of new technologies, rational and effective organization of work process; they adeptly generate interesting ideas for realization; they are originators of many progressive technologies and methods.</p>
<p>The LIE is an ardent opponent of all irrational and ineffective methods of operation. Organizing work and production, he also attributes value to material incentives and personal interest of the workers.</p>
<p>Prefers work of concrete and practical application. He is not seduced by abstract and removed projects.</p>
<p>He is not able to act contrary to his own opinion i.e. contrary to his own conception of what is sensible. Every activity he examines from the point of view of its expediency, its purpose (“otherwise, what for?”). He enjoys working and knows how to produce work of high quality (“otherwise, what’s the point?”).</p>
<p>He considers it expedient to be occupied by a job that generates good profit. He tries not to deal in minor things (usually does not engage in criminal activities, in spite of promising income, since this may go against his system of ethical value, to which he is subconsciously oriented.)</p>
<p>The LIE likes to earn “big” money (“otherwise, what’s the point?”), and enjoys expending it. He doesn’t like as much to save money nor to deny himself in his pleasures and habits. To set a sum aside, to accumulate and grow it, he doesn’t always know how to do. Most readily he spends money that came “easily” to him (as in winning or receiving it as a gift). Generally not inclined to very adventurous projects, the LIE is capable to invest “light” money into enterprise, usually not making solid investments in terms of thinking everything through and making calculated investments.</p>
<p>The LIE doesn’t forgive himself for mistakes and failures, but outwardly he upholds calmness and optimism: “Mistakes are there to learn from them.”</p>
<p>Not petty and piddling, and dislikes this in others. He assumes: if you know how to earn – you have the right to spend. More easily and freely spends large sums of money – more heavily parts with smaller ones, due to which, despite the broadness of his character, may make the impression of being stingy. Irrespective of his income level, the LIE prefers to buy expensive things considering this to be a mark of quality.</p>
<p>He doesn’t like to be occupied with repairs, maintenance, remodeling. He prefers to earn enough and then simply purchase everything new or hire people who will do this work for him.</p>
<p>In difficult times, however, he does not discount doing hard work, if it is rewarded well. The LIE does not like trivial, routine work, does not like working through minor details and specifics, dislikes being “on the pickup”, “on service call”, as well as mindless, unenterprising labor.</p>
<p>The LIE don’t tolerate or allow outside control of his behavior and actions, his time and quality of his work – he considers this to be a sign of distrust which is insulting to him. He considers mutual confidence to be a standard of relationships both in business and in personal life.</p>
<p>Tries not to get involved with irresponsible people, dislikes cheats and charlatans, “dishonest game” and “freeloaders”.</p>
<p>The LIE prefers to promise a little less, but then to do a little more. He thinks of the future outcomes and evaluates his actions from the point of view of their consequences. He dislikes irresponsibility in dealings.</p>
<p>LIE does not like to control someone else’s work in process of its realization – he prefers to evaluate the final result.</p>
<p>Does not like to depend on someone else’s timetable and deadlines, or initiative; therefore prefers work where he can be his own boss: assign his own pace, make his own plans, establish his own standards. Does not like collaborating with a slow partner.</p>
<p>Excellent leader and organizer. The LIE knows how to distribute work with respect to abilities and possibilities of each person. He immediately evaluates people according to their activities, level of qualification, and abilities. The work which he undertakes LIE carries out with the enthusiasm, quickly and qualitatively.</p>
<p>Bureaucratic red-tape LIE sees as a great evil – it frustrates him greatly, kills his business activity and depresses him. The need to live under the conditions, where his business qualities find no application, where his labor does nor earn adequate payment – this suppresses him. He tries not to remain in such an environment for long. The LIE is very dynamic; he easily adapts to new conditions, stoically endures burdens and deprivations (especially, if he is aware that over the course of time such exertion will be quite profitable).</p>
<p>Representatives of this type work well in extreme environments and conditions (rescuers, emergency personnel, testers and pioneers, stuntmen). Specifically, in extreme situations the LIE most readily manifests his volitional qualities, endurance, composure, logical keenness, and also the talent to accurately calculate his timing, forces and possibilities (when he is relaxed, however, he can generally forget about timeliness).</p>
<p>The LIE never gives up before the difficulties but mobilizes all his energies in order to overcome them.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="nd-function-ni-introverted-intuition">
<h3>2nd Function - Ni Introverted intuition<a class="headerlink" href="#nd-function-ni-introverted-intuition" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The LIE is perceptive of advantages that time provides him with.</p>
<p>His talents and qualities manifest most vividly under the conditions for convenient and advantageous for him processes in time. He knows how to see the benefit of future changes, just as as much as he can see the hopelessness and lack of promise of “stagnant periods”.</p>
<p>The LIE knows how to see and to estimate the moment, in which possibilities will open up to him, and knows how to use all the benefits and advantages they offer. He knows how to adapt to difficult times and to endure through them with least losses and damages to himself.</p>
<p>He knows how to make time work for him. He is very precisely aware what to do and when there is a purpose to do it. He knows when to hurry and when to wait. He knows when it is necessary to act decisively, and when it is necessary to patiently endure (though while he’s waiting, he sometimes misses opportunities).</p>
<p>The LIE possesses all necessary qualities in order to adapt to the conditions of uncertain and unstable life. For example, he knows how not to reveal that he is interested in some deal or transaction – in order not to place himself in unfavorable position. He knows how to be self-possessed and patient, however straining this may be for him. He knows how not to reveal his incompetence – in order to not lower his prestige. He knows how not to encourage in vain – in order not to create a reputation for himself of an irresponsible person (although in this, unfortunately, he does not always succeed).</p>
<p>Under unfavorable circumstances, decisive actions alternate with doubts and idleness.</p>
<p>In the period of waiting, it is difficult for him to switch to any other activity; therefore sometimes there is impression that he is idling, loafing. (Many LIEs consider themselves lazy, although in reality they really love being active and working).</p>
<p>The LIE hates periods of forced idleness that are due to reasons that do not depend on him: this literally knocks him of the track. In such periods he is not always able to switch to another work – for him, as for any rational type person, all the confusion and mix-ups in affairs are rather inconvenient.</p>
<p>The LIE prefers a saturated rhythm of life and feels himself well when his day is filled to the limit and by every hour with interesting and urgent matters.</p>
<p>And at the same time it would be naïve to assume that with all of his rationality, the LIE would adhere to a strict timetable - he is sufficiently dynamic and intuitive and easily adapts to changes in circumstances. His intuition of time is subordinated to the interests of the matter at hand, to the interests of expediency; therefore he often introduces correctives and adjustments into his plans (which in turn can be expressed in such incidents as arriving late to a meeting, or scheduling two meeting narrowly spaced in time in two distant places.)</p>
<p>It does not make sense to ask LIE when he plans to return hom or about his plans for the evening. He for sure will not answer such questions with much specificity (moreover, such questions usually irritate him.) Leaving the house, he automatically transforms into the “hunter after success” who orients by his intuition. Therefore, even LIE himself doesn’t know approximately how long will be his work day (which has the effect of complicating the lives of the members of his household).</p>
<p>It is not characteristic for LIE to subordinate his affairs to some schedule. For example, to put aside unfinished work and run to a meeting - he can only do in the cases when the relationship is of much significance for him. (Precisely such a “sacrifice” is required from him on first stages of dualization with Dreiser.)</p>
<p>In the childhood, LIEs also don’t like drafting for themselves an strict schedule for the day: maybe while he’s sitting sitting at home and doing homework, something very interesting will happen in the yard, which requires his participation. Practice shows that daily schedules that Jacks make in childhood, are not observed by them for longer than a couple of days.</p>
<p>Under favorable circumstances, LIE’s plan for the day is frequently condensed: he can get marked off at a lecture in his college, then run to a coin-operated telephone to settle some matter, then run somewhere else to earn extra credit, and after this return back to continue listening to the lecture. Alternatively: he can ask for a leave for a week from his studies, travel to another country, complete a heap of tasks and matters, visit his relatives, make new professional connections, return back to his studies, and in two days make up what he has missed.</p>
<p>If the day of LIE is not filled sufficiently with at least somewhat serious matters, this is a sure sign that he is going through difficult times. (Jacks hate idleness, but unproductive expenditure of time and energy he hates even more).</p>
<p>He feels irritated by any unforeseen expenditure of time. Sluggishness, in all its manifestations, is irritating to him; for example, when someone is talking slowly. Most of all, he is irritated when someone ahead of him is moving or driving slowly. Traffic jams are a kind of monstrous torture for him.</p>
<p>LIE can’t stand having to wait (although frequently he forces others to wait). For him, there is nothing more stupid than to stand at a bus stop waiting for bus to arrive. Therefore, LIEs often try to have their own means of transportation, even if this is only an old bicycle. In the absence of personal transport, they may prefer to get around by foot.</p>
<p>LIEs adore fast rides. And it is useless to counter this. In spite of their pragmatic bent, they are ready to pay whatever fines, but they won’t refuse themselves in this pleasure.</p>
<p>Jack loves quick pace of work, and in general prefers to do everything quickly, preferably in a single session. He prefers the process of preparation to take the minimum of time - otherwise he will no longer want to work. LIE likes to do all his work quickly and qualitatively and then with pleasure spend time in a pleasant company.</p>
<p>He doesn’t like going to the stores and to making purchases, since he doesn’t like standing in lines and, furthermore, he finds it difficult to evaluate the quality of things. Paying visits to different offices and sitting waiting in lines* is not for him (for the same reason that he doesn’t like visiting doctors).</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>translator’s note: This passage about “standing in lines” is a relic from Soviet times, when standing and waiting in lines for hours to obtain basic products and services was one of defining features of everyday life.</p>
</div>
<p>LIE also dislikes being distracted from work to provide explanations, which he has already given many times before; it irritates him when he is unexpectedly assigned someone else’s work which interferes with his own plans. (LIE in general dislikes when someone else frustrates his plans and objectives – it’s another matter, when he himself changes them.)</p>
<p>His mottoes are “Time doesn’t wait” and “Time is money”. He values his time a lot. Thus LIEs plans are usually flexible and dynamic enough to save him on this valuable “commodity”. For him the most convenient partner would be someone who is considerate of his plans and capable of adjusting slightly to them. (This is subconsciously accomplished by his dual, ESI.)</p>

<h3>3rd Function - Fe Extraverted ethics<a class="headerlink" href="#rd-function-fe-extraverted-ethics" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Sometimes there is an impression that it is not entirely clear to the LIE why he has emotions and what he should do with them. At times, he appears before others wearing a mask of a simple-minded, jovial, easy-going fellow, familiar and genuinely “one of us”, while at other times he assumes a mask of facetious gravity and seriousness.</p>
<p>As a rule, the emotions of LIE are subordinated to his logic and manifest in the form in which they are needed for the matter at hand. In the “interests of the matter” the LIE can not reveal any emotions, or to express something to the opposite of what he’s actually feeling.</p>
<p>In the contact, he often manifests friendliness, knows how to be communicable and diplomatic. He tries to find common language in any company, knows how to be charming and witty. He positively predisposes people towards himself. He values good humor and jokes, charges all with his joviality and optimism, loves to tell anecdotes. Due to these qualities, Jack soothes and relaxes his eternally guarded dual, Dreiser.</p>
<p>Sometimes, in the initial stages of dualization, some problems arise with LIE’s jokes that are not always inappropriate and may have undertones of black humor; or sometimes consist of silly ruses. Worst of all for Dreiser are LIE’s crude and vulgar jokes which don’t simply repulse Dreiser, but throw him off as such a large psychological distance, from which it is not always possible to recover. Spending time in Dreiser’s company, LIE becomes more selective in his forms of humor.</p>
<p>The same happens to LIE’s habit to “emotionally express himself”: after spending time with Dreiser his emotional lexicon becomes substantially improvised*. In the company of his dual the LIE tries to be polite, and in the course of time this becomes an integral part of its behavior.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>translator’s note: what is implied here is cursing, that after being subjected to ethical guidance of ESI the LIE’s expression style becomes less crude</p>
</div>
<p>Under the mask of a joker and jovial merry fellow, the LIE frequently attempts to conceal his experiences and feelings. But they can never be hidden from his dual. The ESI demands from LIE sincere and frank emotions, which correspond to the actual state of things.</p>
<p>The LIE does not tolerate emotional pressuring, or, more exactly, he endures it as he would endure a natural calamity: his pulls himself together, gathers all his willpower, and patiently waits out until this testing ends. Those, who wants to become a good partner of any of the representatives of this type, should know that LIE should be not reproached and nagged (although he frequently provokes exactly this by his behavior): this will not lead to positive results, but will spoil relations such that mending them will be practically impossible.</p>
<p>The LIE generally painfully perceives negative emotions from those around him. For example, when he is shown offence, irritation, hostility, antipathy towards him. He cannot tolerate when someone breaks out in tears, becomes hysterical, provokes him to jealousy or a quarrel. This frightens and paralyzes him: LIE with all his external alertness is nevertheless usually amicable and well-wishing.</p>
<p>He doesn’t want to cause offense or suffering to anyone else (even inadvertently). He tries to avoid producing unpleasant impressions and leaving behind poor opinions and memories. Therefore he is in need of constant ethical correction from the side of his partner, which, it goes without saying, happens most naturally for him in the partnership with his dual, Dreiser, since it is Dreiser’s ethical values at which Jack is subconsciously oriented. For example, if someone turns to LIE with a difficult to complete request, he tries not to turn the person down (even if he already knows that the request is impracticable, he doesn’t categorically reject it, since he is subconsciously predisposed to the vulnerable ethics of his dual, Dreiser, who receives the flat refusal as the break of relations).</p>
<p>The most difficult ethical situation for the LIE is when his partner withdraws and becomes deeply closed off. (Such a state is characteristic of Dreiser in crisis situations, and LIE perceives it as a signal of alarm.) Uncertainty in emotions expressed very much disturbs and worries him. He literally begins to feel bad when he sees that he has truly offended his partner. In such moments, he walks around his partner in circles, looking intently at her face and attempting to understand what is happening. From his side he is prepared to go for any concessions, to do everything in his power, only to bring his partner out of this state.</p>
<p>LIE is able to quickly and easily engage other people, thus LIEs, as no one else, are able to “accrete” with friends. However, it would be incorrect to consider that it is easy to win over representatives of this type. The LIE doesn’t allow everyone to get close. At a distance, they are very distrustful - and in this they are very similar to their dual, Dreiser. Furthermore, LIEs are aware of the fact that they don’t always know how correctly analyze and assess someone’s character (this they will be learning their entire lives). For this reason, they dislike making acquaintances “blindly”. They don’t like when someone imposes their acquaintance on them. However, at a close distance they are very trusting, even too much so.</p>
<p>To betray the confidence of LIE means to forever lose his friendship and respect. LIEs go through disappointments in friendship and love with great difficulty, since loyalty and faithfulness for them are the most important ethical values. LIEs can even take revenge for abuse of their confidence, even though they are usually not vindictive by nature. They do not tolerate lies, hypocrisy, insults in any shape and form. The manifestation of any of these enrages them. LIE may even resort to physical force in order to defend his interests.</p>
<p>Hot temper is usually not characteristic of LIEs. Usually they are balanced people who are not easily agitated (most frequently of phlegmatic temperament). LIEs try to keep their emotions in check and avoid contact with those who frustrate them. They are considerate of emotional state of others and ask for the same for themselves.</p>
<p>Interacting with an unfamiliar person from a distance, Jack sometimes without any visible reason “let out his prickles”. (He declares himself “a lone wolf”.) One needs to possess exceptional ethical courage to address such a “prickly LIE” with an affectionate word. Fortunately, for his their dual, Dreiser, this is not a problem. Behind this external prickliness, ESI sees only a sensitive and vulnerable soul that needs a very caring approach. Dreiser, personally, is not frightened of this edginess and prickliness of LIE, but to the contrary even pleasantly refreshed. Sufficiently confident in herself or himself Dreiser is capable of taming even the most unapproachable “lone wolf” LIE.</p>

<h3>4th Function - Si Introverted sensing<a class="headerlink" href="#th-function-si-introverted-sensing" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>LIE frequently senses some kind of discomfort with himself and with his surroundings. In his movements there is frequently a measure of constraint, even lack of coordination, angularity and tension in combination with awkwardness.</p>
<p>LIE feels irritated when he experiences uncomfortable sensations. He is irritated because feels ashamed of them. He doesn’t understand, why, for example, he can show exceptional endurance in extreme situations, while under the normal conditions he becomes so sensitive to such trifles.</p>
<p>When it comes to his sensations, he has little sense of measure. Therefore, he needs a partner who would sense this for him, who would know his tastes, his habits, who can foresee which sensations LIE will experience in the next moment.</p>
<p>LIE may not take care of himself, which is why preemptive care and concern provided by his partner is so important for him. It is important that LIE has all the necessary conditions for wholesome leisure and rest. It doesn’t matter if he was occupied by work all day or did nothing; even if he recently woke up and immediately went to watch TV, one shouldn’t grumble: it means that right now he needs to “recharge” by some new information and impressions. Furthermore, it is precisely during the period of “forced hibernation” and inaction that the LIE experiences most uneasiness and stress.</p>
<p>When he is in his normal “working” regime, he generally very rarely allows himself to rest and relax. Therefore, if LIE has set out to take a break, don’t strain and burden him: this will irritate him greatly. If he has sat down to eat, don’t move him from place to place, or distract him at this moment by conversations or telephone calls. (Although at his work place, he can eat and work simultaneously.)</p>
<p>When LIE has to take care of himself, he cannot relax. Caring for himself for him is an excess and not always expedient investment of effort, since in his daily life he is undemanding and can do with little. Receiving care from his partner, LIE is counting on him helping him to relax. Thus, he reacts painfully to the slightest manifestations of discomfort. For example, absence of hot water at his office is fine, but absence of hot water at home is a serious disappointment for him. (Why does Dreiser need to know the time when he will be coming back from work? So that he can heat some water, prepare a hot meal, and finish all chores at home such that nothing would ruin LIE’s repose.)</p>
<p>Female LIEs very unwillingly take up housework (LIE-housewife is generally an exceptional phenomenon, especially today). They are especially frustrated with the need to be torn between home and work: “I urgently need to do some research, and here I am, cooking soup at the stove, and will have to do some cleaning after…” Taking a leave for the reason of caring for their children female LIEs try to arrange such that it coincides with least productive periods in their career: “I’ve decided that while I’m still adjusting to my new job, still learning a new language, since I’m sitting home then in this time I will try to have a child.”</p>
<p>The female LIE doesn’t always successfully select clothing and cosmetics for herself. (It should be noted that female representatives of this type are attractive precisely by their natural looks - cosmetics seldom improves their look, even if makeup is applied professionally.) Many representatives of this type even possessing classically beautiful features consider themselves unattractive. Considering their faces to be unappealing (moreover, completely undeservedly), they can hide it under the enormous black glasses, so that for others it remains a mystery whether their eyes are really ugly, or is it a myth?</p>
<p>Most likely, this is a myth. The LIE is almost never confident in his own taste, in the aesthetic value of his appearance, in his manners and behavior, which, incidentally, leads to the excessive shyness and “prickliness”. He poorly feels others’ disposition towards himself, whether he is liked or dislikes. He is not confident that he can evoke positive emotions and be loved by someone (and in this is his major mistake!). He does not feel his own attractiveness, does not like himself enough.</p>
<p>In a holiday or ceremonial-official atmosphere, LIE feels uncomfortable and constrained. He feels well in situations which do not require pomp and ceremony: out in nature, in the forest, on a hike, where he can wear simple or sporty clothing, behave naturally, excluding affectation.</p>
<p>Sometimes the aesthetical self-appraisal of the LIE is so understated that he prefers to surround itself by clearly deficient people, sometimes even with the physical deviations. Or he may prefer rude and cheap entertainment in the company of people of low social status.</p>
<p>LIE isn’t bothered much by all the disorder in his life. He is often indifferent to aesthetical qualities of things. Frequently, there is some kind of aesthetical nonsense present in the way he dresses. Knowing about this flaw of theirs, LIEs tend to dislike when they are visually scrutinized at point blank. Therefore, Dreiser never looks at LIE with her “piercing” look (at a close psychological distance ESI generally doesn’t look in this manner) and never makes comments about deficiencies in LIE’s external appearance and clothing – Dreiser will either sincerely sympathize with a person who is dressed uncomfortably, or take direct involvement in solving this problem, but will not criticize, unless of course Dreiser is requested to do this.</p>
<p>Instances when someone shows concrete care for him, LIE interprets as expressions of positive attitude. Only with such a partner he properly relaxes, only to him or her he truly entrusts.</p>
<p>Receiving sufficient support of his weak function, LIE “opens up” to receiving information on his suggestive (dual-seeking) function. However, this is a topic for the next section.</p>
</div>

<div class="section" id="th-function-fi-introverted-ethics">
<h3>5th Function - Fi Introverted ethics<a class="headerlink" href="#th-function-fi-introverted-ethics" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>This function forms the most fundamental values of this type. It is “blind”. It is passive. It is realized subconsciously and constitutes a “storehouse” for holding life values and orientations, which then form the worldview of LIE. This is an indicator with which he evaluates information concerning actions and behaviors of those around him.</p>
<p>To the LIE it is necessary to know the origins, the motives of actions of various people, to know who relates to him well and around whom it would be advisable to be more guarded. Since for LIE it is very difficult to analyze and grasp this on his own, he is in need of a person who excellently understands all the nuances and specifics of relationships and who can always provide a detailed analysis concerning this issue. (Precisely in this his dual, Dreiser, orients very well.)</p>
<p>Subconsciously oriented at such ethical values and emotional guidelines, LIE will also defend and preserve the most important of them – friendship, love, devotion to the interests of the project, to the interests of his “team” – these form the positive basis for his ethics, his ethical foundation.</p>
<p>Similar to his dual, LIE imposes on his partner very high ethical requirements, although he has much more tolerance for some insignificant deviations from his standards. In contrast to his dual, LIE doesn’t always feel when he is being deceived: this he assesses logically, but, once catching his partner on lying will never forget or forgive.</p>
<p>Any crises in relations, LIE perceives very painfully. The most terrible thing for him is when his partner either cannot or does not want to bring him out of this state. (Dreiser, in this respect, is again a preferable partner: not only will Dreiser not allow such crises to occur, but he won’t leave even a trace of uncertainty behind.)</p>
<p>In process of forming relations, LIE is subconsciously counting on his partner to take all the initiative. ESI is indeed predisposed to taking all ethical and volitional onto her shoulders (if, of course, she is not too constrained by the prejudices and social expectations). From his side, LIE gladly takes all the initiative related to taking objectively logical actions within the course of development of relations: he will find ways to overcome all obstacles, cover any distances – only so that his partner would experience no difficulties or inconveniences.</p>
<p>The main problem of LIE is that ESI is not the only type capable of taking initiative for development of relations. (Furthermore, as any dual, Dreiser is usually the least conspicuous and the least attractive.) Thus, LIEs frequently allow initiative to pass to psychologically incompatible with them partners, which resonates especially painfully precisely in periods of crises in their relationships: partners of logical types, for example, possessing weak ethics, cannot deliver the relationship out of crises, while psychologically incompatible partners of ethical types are capable of provoking complications intently, in order to use this as means of emotional pressuring.</p>
<p>Jack always notices when someone tries to manipulate his emotions. Another matter, he doesn’t always know how he should react and respond to this. He needs time to analyze and understand what motives and attitudes stand behind such manipulations and games. If he comes to the conclusion that these relations don’t particularly complicate his life, then he can be pulled into the ethical game that is foreign to him. Although, in principle, LIE doesn’t recognize any ethical games: he hates hypocrisy, indirectness, double-speak, insincerity; he cannot stand when he is being deceived by cunning, when some indeterminate ethical goals are set behind him (in other words, when someone is playing games and fooling him).</p>
<p>LIEs are not easily “led astray” from their “other half”. In cases of strong psychological discomfort and incapacity to change anything in the relationship, he can leave his family, but he won’t “go astray” in cases of more attractive alternatives.</p>
<p>With all his seeming external mobility, LIEs are actually quite conservative in ethical sense, which creates certain problems in the cases of unions with psychologically incompatible partners. Dreiser is the only partner who can guarantee minimum of problems on the aspect of the ethics of relations with LIE.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="th-function-se-extraverted-sensing">
<h3>6th Function - Se Extraverted sensing<a class="headerlink" href="#th-function-se-extraverted-sensing" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>As has already been mentioned, the objective achievements of LIE depend more on favorable conditions rather than his personal volitional efforts. And nevertheless, he often brings himself out of critical situations precisely by physical exertion, which he decides to undertake if not from personal motives, then at least in the interests of his partner or his friends for whom he feels responsible.</p>
<p>With all of his pragmatism and practicality, LIEs have a tendency to periodically “hover in the clouds”. It would seem that the LIE should not do anything inexpedient, since this contradicts his main program. Nevertheless, sometimes he discovers that his goals were mere mirages (since, as any intuitive type, he doesn’t always realistically look at things). In such period, a lot depends on how soon LIE can make himself invest the required effort, to set faulty plans aside, to come up with new goals and orient himself at their realization.</p>
<p>LIEs needs a partner who can orient him at practical goals and persuade him in evanescence of his previous goals. By himself, the LIE finds it difficult to make the necessary effort especially when his previous plans have collapsed. He is activated when in his life appears a new purpose that corresponds to his main program, that has positive and concrete value, a well defined direction, and an opportunity to apply actual forces – a goal which will bring him out of forced idleness and useless expectation of changes, a goal for which he will want to actively work and to surmount difficulties. Precisely such a goal sets before him his dual Dreiser (who is not able to see future prospects very well, but will sufficiently distinctly see the lack of promise of some undertakings, and therefore will not allow LIE to get stuck on some distant and unrealistic projects. Creatively manipulating various methods of volitional influence, Dreiser forces Jack to switch to more realistic, concrete and needed tasks).</p>
<p>LIE does not like to neglect his undertaking. Nevertheless, this is exactly what will periodically happen. Since for him “fixing” the neglected matters is also unpleasant, as is mending anything broken, next to him must be someone, who will force him to it.</p>
<p>Of course, it is impossible to make the LIE obey direct volitional pressuring – this he won’t allow. Moreover, such methods deliver a blow to his ethics of relations. Thus, in dealing with LIE, volitional pressuring must be flexible, creative, and ethics of relations must be personal and firm in principle. Then, as much offended as he will be that he is constantly forced to make an effort, these offences must be quickly smoothed out by his partner such that they don’t threaten the relationship (which is possible only in partnership with Dreiser).</p>
<p>As any intuitive, LIE by his nature is sufficiently scattered. He doesn’t always remember where he placed some item or another. Cleaning and ordering for him are not the most pleasant occupations. Nevertheless, when LIE, with his entire indifference to the everyday disorder, finds himself in conditions where order is strictly followed and maintained (as Dreiser usually does in his house), this organizes and vitalizes him.</p>
<p>One of the first signs that LIE is over difficult times is him taking an interest in ordering his life, taking up sports, looking after his health, conducting physical and intellectual work on himself.</p>
<p>Jack will readily do any work, provide any service at the request of another, than on his own initiative (if this is necessary for someone – then it makes sense to do).</p>
<p>LIEs themselves don’t strive to subordinate someone else to their will. (LIE knows well how to organize work, how to distribute tasks, but forcing someone to work is not for him. For him, it is easier to stimulate others materially, to spark their interest and curiosity, to inspire by his own enthusiasm, but to force - this is not his method. Incidentally, he won’t ask and make requests either: it’s not guaranteed that he won’t receive a rejection, and for him this is always unpleasant.)</p>
<p>The LIE is a democratic type. He is not attracted by any external markings of power, connections, position in society, and dislikes those who boast by these. He evaluates people according to their real abilities and actual results. He sees the advantages granted by authority only as a possibility to realize his own creative potential. LIEs are thus not inclined to abuse their power. Moreover, they also don’t subordinate themselves to strict and unfair, in their opinion, orders. At their own risk, they won’t follow inhumane instructions.</p>
<p>The LIE readily takes on the role of a leader and usually handles it well. The more empowered he is, the more activate he becomes, and the more successful and large scale his work will be.</p>

<div class="section" id="th-function-ti-introverted-logic">
<h3>7th Function -Ti Introverted logic<a class="headerlink" href="#th-function-ti-introverted-logic" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>This function supplements the logical program of the LIE, prepares theoretical base for him, collection and information processing are accomplished. His consistency and authenticity are checked.</p>
<p>The LIE it is possible to convince only by facts and logically irreproachable concepts. Subconsiously he always notes for himself all logical discrepancies and actual nonconformities in any thought expressed to him, in any theory proposed to him. He possesses excellent memory, he easily memorizes new information, trying to immediately systematize it.</p>
<p>Information he collects very thoroughly, as far as possible from very authoritative sources. For the LIE it is very important precisely the authenticity of information sources. As a rule, he rests only on those facts, of authenticity of which he is personally convinced. Therefore to him, it is always unpleasant to be disappointed in the information source: for the LIE this is just as disappointment in the friendship - it was entrusted, and they brought it[ –]</p>
<p>The collection of information in LIEs is complicated by the fact that they cannot allow themselves to too extend this process in the time: indeed so matter itself already can become late. Undertaking new big deal, he always tries to obtain the precisely comprehensive information: on the basis of the interests of matter and feeling of responsibility before its command, it does not make possible for himself to lightly relate to this question. Gathering information, the LIE tries to be maximally foresighted and farsighted - it compulsorily should consider possible changes and changes of the conditions in the future. (for example: checking the article of expenditure, he, as a rule, considers his dependence on some unforeseen circumstances: a possible increase in the prices, inflation, increase in the taxes, increase in the tariffs on the services, connected with the maintenance and the insurance. I.e., the collection of information is achieved “on application” his subsequent mental function - “intuition of possibilities”.)</p>
<p>It is characteristic of the LIE to notice any distortion of information known to him. He dislikes greatly, when people “distort” facts and thus they distort truth - this deeply agitates him. However relaxed he was, it would seem, any logical contradiction immediately pricks up his ears. LIE - fundamental enemy of manipulation with facts, even if this does not change the essence of concept. He won’t always easily agree to recognize that one and the same fact is the consequence of the most different reasons. And not because he has in principle difficultly understanding: accepting any theory, it is important for the LIE to be confident in his logical understanding.</p>
<p>In exactly the same manner, accepting any information, he must be confident, that it is not based at the manipulation of facts. (in connection with this, sometimes problems appear in the initial stage of the dualization of the LIE with ESI: in the ESI, as is known, there is manipulation ethics, and the ESI is sufficiently free with the facts - to one and the same fact, she can attach the opposite value, and she does not see a big sin in this. This circumstance will prick up ears of the LIE, until he understands that the ESI’s logic is no more than a form of persuasion, which is exactly calculated for him, the LIE).</p>
<p>The LIE tries to construct all his actions on the basis of repeatedly checked personal experience (his technological procedures he develops also on the basis of repeated experiments. Therefore any criticism of his own tested procedures, he receives very painfully.)</p>
<p>In the region of scientific experiments the LIEs very boldly make their personal experience, and, beginning from the earliest childhood. [–] Greatly they love to develop, they dream to move apart the horizons of science. Greatly they are proud of their inventions, regardless of the fact how this affects those surrounding.</p>
<p>The theoretical logic of the LIE creates information base and it is the prerequisite of its subsequent mental function - the intuition of possibilities.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="th-function-ne-extraverted-intuition">
<h3>8th Function - Ne Extraverted intuition<a class="headerlink" href="#th-function-ne-extraverted-intuition" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>This aspect is extremely important for the LIE. He subconsiously compares his own possibilities to the possibilities of others, because this is that region, in which it is constantly is desirable to work at himself and to without fail obtain appreciation. (it should not be supposed that because of this quality the LIE is envious to the successes of others - in no case! And although he actually does not love, when to him someone mentions as example other people, who achieved more in life than the LIE, but this is only because he usually prefers to decide for himself what successes it is worthwhile to imitate, and which are not.)</p>
<p>Subconsiously the LIE feels, that this quality is given him in order to rescue someone, to help out those, who are weaker than him, who fell into the misfortune, which is explained by subconsious orientation to the weak intuition of his dual ESI. (many representatives of this type in the childhood they dreamed to work as firemen, to accomplish exploits and to protect weak).</p>
<p>The LIE prepares himself his entire life itself for this mission. During entire life he learns to overcome obstacles, he dreams to develop in himself some supernatural possibilities. Even at the ripe age he can with pleasure look at any [–] fighter, identifying himself on the spot with the invincible film hero.</p>
<p>The LIE respects people, who achieved much in the life because of their diligence, fearlessness, perseverance, foresight, common sense,; he respects people with the fantasy, people, who develop their abilities. He is reckless, he loves to participate in the contests of force, adroitness and endurance. Moreover he is connected spontaneously to such contests. (for example, in him it can arise the desire to repeat the recently seen acrobatic trick.) Easily he is included in bet, in the youth it iis possible to easily take on “weakly”. The LIE from the earliest age begins to get interested in the limit of his physical possibilities, the limit of his endurance and courage. (ten-year old female LIE “was experiencing” herself, sitting on top of the rails of balcony, at the height of the eighth floor)</p>
<p>To LIEs it is very important to trace the boundaries of the permissible possibilities. And if, it occurs, in the first experiments they still sometimes [–], then are repeated their “records” as far as possible repeatedly. And they are proud of this. (moreover these “records” they are far from always worthy model for the imitation - sometimes they they bear clearly “hussar” nature.) LIEs love to demonstrate their fearlessness and courage. In the youth they frequently manifest demonstrative recklessness, carelessness, know how and love to risk. Saying about his achievements, LIE never claims anything excess - he does not love empty bragging. If someone doubts his exploits, he is ready to here demonstrate them.</p>
<p>At the ripe age the risk of LIE is based on precise calculations and well developed intuition. They love to play into the game of chances, frequently buy lottery tickets, although their laziness is to go to verify its gain. For them this not is more than the expectation of happy changes or the unique training of intuition, like as “weather report”, on which they check, does regard with favor by them today success.</p>
<p>Speaking about his successes, the LIE tries not to subject to criticism the possibility and ability of others. He tries not to discuss them. (subconsiously he is disposed to the weak intuition of the ESI) [ –] Even if presents the question “to the filling in”, then only from the inquisitiveness, and not of self assertion.</p>
<p>To LIEs it is always interesting to learn life on its steepest fractures. Impression sometimes is created, that they live as in the adventure motion-picture film. To [–] prepares himself for the serious vital tests. Them they draw the romantic of the risky adventures, work under the conditions of the increased danger, under the severe climatic conditions. Many of them try themselves in different forms of sport. For the LIE it is always desirable to test what he yet did not experience. Even if for him it was necessary in the life, for example, to conduct ship, he will regret about the fact that here it still never governed aircraft. Another example - if any new road is opened, for the LIE compulsorily he must drive on it: “as this, already three days, as they built new bridge, but still not the time to cross it!” LIEs- innate pioneers, first- testers. To the LIE it is necessary to try everything which is new for it [–].</p>
<p>LIE - whimperer - this exceptional phenomenon. Rarely who only from the closest environment can see him in the depressed state, that not hiding his desperation. (of course under the conditions of psychological discomfort the LIE as any person, “is unscrewed”, and consequently he can be whining, and be irritated on the trifles, but for the psychologically balanced LIE this not characteristic)</p>
<p>Representatives of this type badly receive death as reality, they do not believe that they can lose close person, and for this very reason the loss of their close ones they survive exceptionally painfully (although they hide their experiences).</p>
<p>LIEs are very life-loving and optimistic, they love the saturated vital rhythm: active, dynamic labor and productive leisure. They love journeys, marches on the kayaks or the bicycles, love tourist songs, smoke of bonfire, to the romantic of wanderings. They love to listen to and to read history about any irregular phenomena, they are interested in fantasy and adventures. They frequently strike with the extraordinary latitude of knowledge in many regions.</p>
<p>LIEs usually try not to bring any one, moreover, into the difficult minute it sees its responsibility in finding of way out from any difficult situation, not only for himself, but also for “his dependents”.</p>
<p>“His dependents” for the LIE - holy concept. On the request of friend it can go both into the fire and into the water: he can, for example, unselfishly return the blood for the man completely familiar to him, he can return all his savings to friends, who proved to be themselves friends in the difficult situation. For the rescuing of its dependents the LIE can accomplish the miracles of courage, resourcefulness and endurance (and nevertheless in private life he can be completely indifferent to requests and commissions of its close ones).</p>
<p>The LIE feels completely terribly, when he sees that he involuntarily becomes the culprit of the problems of “his dependents”, especially, if he cannot sufficiently rapidly solve these problems.</p>
<p>It irriates him, when someone by anything brings him, or are created, additional problems, which complicate his own plans. The ENTj tries to avoid “problematic” people, and to him it is very always unpleasant to be the source of problems.</p>
<p>With any circumstances he demonstrates confidence and optimism, he tries not to show his fear and not to demonstrate his sufferings. It is always calm, imperturbable, he always speaks in flat and cheerful voice. By his viability, by optimism, by love of life, by healthy adventurism, by fantasy, by the originality of thinking the LIE suggests confidence tomorrow to his dual the ESI, he guides her from many vital blind alleys, inculcates taste for adventures, teaches to be glad at life, the new unknown possibilities are offered before her, makes her life more rich.</p>
