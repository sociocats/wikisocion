<h2>The place of Quadra among other groups<a class="headerlink" href="#the-place-of-quadra-among-other-groups" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Quadra as a typological group was discovered at the dawn of socionics by A. Augustinavichiute. It was assigned the properties of most comfortable
and productive group. Since those times, this concept has been elevated
to a kind of a cult. Aushra herself has even promoted a slogan of
“quadratization of society” [1] i.e. connecting people into groups on
principle of their quadra belonging, which was supposed to provide each
person with a long awaited feeling of freedom and happiness.
Unfortunately, many of the current schools of thought in socionics
haven’t progressed far beyond this hype and are still looking for the
causes of social and psychological unsettlement and dissatisfaction of
an individual in being forcefully subjected to conditions of “foreign”
quadra.</p>
<p>The school of type analysis in principle opposes any kind of
absolutization as an approach that is deprived of any logical basis. If
in actuality there existed any such ideal group, then it would have
become established and reinforced by social norms and practices as well
as by natural selection. So far, the magic power of quadral groupings
has not been demonstrated by any experiments. This, of course, doesn’t
mean that it is a completely useless grouping. Among other subgroups of
the Socion, quadra groupings take a special place, because they allow
for modeling of natural chronological cycles.</p>
<p>To take a broader view, A. Aushra has in fact had the honor of
discovering the first functionally complete groups. Functionally
complete groups are defined as groups that include all four of Jungian
functions that reflect the main “sides of the horizon” of communicative
space  perception of the effects of surrounding world through senses
(Sensing - S), their formatting by means of generalization into concepts
(Intuition - N), their comparisons and contrasts and decision making
(Logic - T) and subjective-emotional assessment of people and events
(Ethics - F).</p>
<p>Quadra is one of the functionally complete groups, and thus it is very
different from functionally-specific groupings, that are based shared
one or two of Jungian functions. Certainly, it is not possible to build
a quadra solely based on Jungian functions. By method of recombining
them in pairs, it is possible to divide the Socion into six kinds of
small groups, and all of them will be specialized in their nature
unite the sociotypes that are funtionally more alike each other than
different. The list of groups formed on Jung’s basis the reader can find
in my work “Typological Wholeness of the Socion” [7].</p>
<p>Quadra due to their particular historical origin have interested me for
a long time. My first independent topic in socionics has been quadral
dynamics. This topic I have discussed at length with A. Aushra. The main
conclusion at which I have arrived at that time was the effectiveness of
intraquadral unwinding of the Socion for modeling processes that unfold
over sufficiently long periods of time [4,5]. Since quadral groupings
formed a good approximation to the peculiarities of the psychology of
completed historical epochs, I have drawn from this concept for modeling
macro-evolution in society.</p>
<p>A functionally specialized group is strongly dependent on its location
in communicative space: if, for example, a group of “managers” (STs)
finds itself in the humanitarian sphere (NF), it won’t be of much use or
help  it will simply try to impose its “technical” way of life, or will
be put in its place by united against them humanitarians. A functionally
complete group practically is independent from its location in
communicative space, since it is universal in the level of solvable
issues. Instead, it is very dependent on the factor of time: such groups
are not quickly organized, a period of frictions and adjustments is
needed, when informal distribution of roles and timely succession of
relay of communicative estafette take place. This characteristic of
functionally complete groups being endowed with a inner fixed rhythm
gave me an idea that quadral groupings reflect discrete periods of the
unfolding of any natural process in time.</p>
<p>Many heated discussions have happened in the Kiev socionics club and
during socionics conferences on the topic of quadral succession in the
progression and evolution of history. However, many questions still
remain unclear. In particular, is it needed that during the era of one
or another quadra the main leadership positions are occupied by the
sociotypes belonging to this quadra? In this article, I will try to
provide a systematic presentation of all the information on quadral
groupings, that has accumulated over the years.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="differentiating-traits-of-quadra">
<h2>Differentiating traits of Quadra<a class="headerlink" href="#differentiating-traits-of-quadra" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Quadra, as any other subgroup of four sociotypes distinguished in the
Socion, can be described analytically through the commutative (not
dependent on relocations) sum of three dichotomous scales. These three
oppositions I call the differentiating features of quadra. All of them
are included in the well-known list of Reinin, but very little
researched in practice.</p>
<p>In this article, one pair of traits I will name same as A. Aushra, since
this name is already fixed in everyday socionics practice. This is the
dichotomy “democrats - aristocrats”. Two other pairs of traits will be
given names that differ from those given to them by A. Aushra, as the
old names are rather awkward, both by their meaning and by their use
that puts them on the same level as conventional everyday language. They
seems to have been randomly and hastily chosen terms, to not leave newly
originating concepts without terminological designations.</p>
<p>Instead of the dichotomy “merry - serious”, that is far from the
requirements of practice, I will be introducing a pair of opposing
traits “ascending - descending”. Instead of the pair of traits
“judicious - decisive”, which introduces considerable terminological
confusion due to “judicious” being not seldom equated as a synonym to
“rational”, I will use a more accurate in that sense dichotomy “central - peripheral”.</p>
<div class="section" id="aristocrats-and-democrats">
<h3>Aristocrats and Democrats<a class="headerlink" href="#aristocrats-and-democrats" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>“ARISTOCRATS” (second and fourth quadra). These sociotypes are
distinguished by predominance of vertical communication over horizontal.
When vertical communication connections there is always a hierarchical
inequality: boss - subordinate, senior - junior, our person - another
person, etc. Such communication will inevitably have the nature of
subordination. A person in aristocratic quadra is evaluated primarily by
his communicative status respective to the person who is doing the
evaluation (is he on my level or not?), and later on the other criteria.</p>
<p>The degree of expression of the “aristocratic” trait, understood in a
broad sense as subordination, is different for two aristocratic quadra.
The second quadra has a more vividly expressed “aristocratic” trait than
the fourth one. “Aristocracy” of second quadra is harsh and undisguised.
It is always the division into servants and masters, talent and
mediocrity, friends and enemies, which inevitably leads to a caste based
social structure in the period of predominance of second quadra.</p>
<p>In the fourth quadra there are no such social contrasts, therefore their
“aristocratic” trait appears to be smoothed out. However, types from
this quadra are also guided by the principle “ours - theirs” in
assessing people. Are others living by the same laws as we are? Neither
do doubts about the optimal nature of this quadra’s priorities come up.
The image of an enemy, as in the second quadra, is not formed, but
people who behave in uncivilized way or simply intellectually immature
individuals are put into second-class category.</p>
<p>For “aristocratic” quadra time flows linearly and not cyclically. They
can clearly separate past from future. Second quadra is oriented towards
the future: this quadra is similar to a fired arrow that pierces time.
Past is not valuable for the second quadra, on the contrary, it always
carries a negative connotation. In the best case it is declared that it
is needed to take up the most valuable developments, and move ahead. It
is the second quadratic that produces ideas of the “ideal” governments
of the future and tries to benefit all humankind by attempting to build
them. The fourth quadra is more focused on the past, which is usually
endowed by a positive image of established traditions that should not be
changed but observed. Sociotypes of fourth quadra are opponents of
various social experiments. In any case, due to the linearity of time
perception in the two “aristocratic” quadras there is no recurrence of
events, standing in one place in time. In periods of “aristocratic”
quadra, there are no long period of stagnation or stasis.</p>
<p>“DEMOCRATS” (first and third quadra). In these quadras the principle of
horizontal communication predominates, that is, communication on equal
terms, when there are no leaders and followers, people who are better or
worse. The partner in communication is put on same level as oneself, not
above or below. Accordingly, the attribute of subordination that is
characteristic of “aristocrats” is missing here. Instead of power of a
higher level center, “democrats” organize coordination between subjects
of same level. Having hierarchical authority in periods of “democratic”
quadra does not give any special privileges.</p>
<p>“Democracy” as a trait is more pronounced in social organization of the
third quadra. This is the most changeable quadra, which is committed to
representational forms of government, constant elections and
re-elections. During the period of the third quadra, tens or even
hundreds of different parties become formed and enter into temporary
coalitions. Interpersonal contacts are maximally informal, titles and
ranks have very little weight here.</p>
<p>The first quadra is not so “democratic”. Although horizontal
communication for members of this quadra is a matter of course, third
quadra’s familiarity that transgresses all boundaries is shocking here.
In the first quadra there is no such blatant individualism. “Democracy”
here is not used it for public broadcasting of one’s deviations from the
norms. In the first quadra there are no struggles of disadvantaged
minorities for their rights, for the simple reason that no one infringes
on their rights in the first place, and minorities do not form with a
harmonious lifestyle. “Democracy” is understood by the first quadra to
rationally follow from natural laws.</p>
<p>“Democratic” quadra do not live in linear but in circular (cyclic) time.
The third quadra has a distinctly undulating rhythm of ups and downs,
which are almost impossible to predict. Therefore, the sociotypes of the
third quadra are very focused on the present moment. Traditions of the
past are not very meaningful for them, they are most concerned about the
near-by future. Stagnation in the life of the third quadra alternates
with periods of turbulent reformations, while its economy is dominated
by the elements of market supply and demand.</p>
<p>In the period of the first quadra, time as if completely stops. This is
the quadra of homeostasis - a dynamic equilibrium of society with its
environment. Violent clashes don’t occur for the most part, life goes on
calmly and harmoniously. First quadra exists outside of time as one big
family, in which one generation takes over the place of previous
generation, reproducing an almost unchanged previously developed
lifestyle. To be part of this “cocoon” is very comfortable, but at the
same time dangerous: any aggression from outside quickly destroys it.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ascending-and-descending">
<h3>Ascending and Descending<a class="headerlink" href="#ascending-and-descending" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>ASCENDING (first and second quadra). Ascending sociotypes move the
trajectory of social development upward. They are the donors of
socio-psychological energy, as they carry in themselves a collectivist
beginning in long term communication. When independent but collectively
oriented individuals come together, as we know, there is an
amplification in the efficiency of action due to direction of effort
toward a common goal. This infuses the surrounding society with
additional energy, which contributes to the acceleration of social
processes.</p>
<p>Another explanation for the acceleration of processes in “ascending”
quadras: their priorities include information aspects E and L (Fe and
Ti), that are responsible for purposeful use of human emotional energy.
In first and second quadra, these information aspects occupy program
positions in blocks of Ego and Superid, which define the
goal-orientation of a sociotype. On the function E emotional involvement
of people occurs, while on the function L logically reasoned action
plans are developed.</p>
<p>The most orderly and energetic is the second quadra, which actualizes
maximal expansion in society. In periods of the second quadra, social
dynamics are directed along the trajectory of maximum ascent up to a
climax, after which comes a downward period of energy-absorbing
development. Second quadra is so full of energy, that when they lose
sight of the purpose for struggle, it begins to destroy itself.</p>
<p>The second quadra is much less full of energy and readiness for struggle
in comparison to the first one, although occasionally it still brings
some energy into the social movement. The second quadra cannot pump
energy in one continuous stream, while burning up inside of it. It
accomplishes its mission of acceleration by portions, cyclically
introducing into the minds of calm and carefree living people seeds of
ideas for a new kind of life. The beginning of the period of second
quadra is associated with static and quietness, but as the development
of new beginnings progresses, the impulses coming from this quadra
become stronger and stronger, until it ignites the second quadra.</p>
<p>“DESCENDING” (third and fourth quadra). Sociotypes of descending quadra
absorb more energy from the surrounding society than they contribute.
They can be considered to be recipients of socio-psychological energy.
When the periods of these quadra come, the trajectory of social
development leans down and has a strong tendency for decreasing the
level of social dynamics. “Descending” sociotypes are most
individualistic than collectivist, and have little desire to join forces
to raise the potential of group effectiveness.</p>
<p>On the other hand, “descending” quadra have common priorities P and R
(Te and Fi), which by themselves do not set things in motion: “logic of
actions” Te is movement based on previously stored energy, and “ethics
of relations” Fi symbolizes attachment to an old, established system of
relations. These information aspects are categorized as inertial, i.e.
decaying with time processes. Therefore both quadra slow the movement of
society, turning life to decline and abandonment of the future, as it
happens to a person in the second half of his life.</p>
<p>More “descending”, and therefore “breaking”, is the third quadra. The
onset of the third quadra brings economic disorganization, fall of
spirit and spoiling of morals on a mass level. The third is the most
individualistic one. It operates of principle of every man for himself,
while services for each other have to be paid for. During the periods of
the third quadra, there is a sharp revaluation of values, generations
start to conflict with each other, society goes through a “breaking
point”. Energy is absorbed on large scale for internal competitions and
internecine wars.</p>
<p>Fourth quadra is characterized by calm nature and a sober outlook on
life. Therefore, the stored energy is not spent so rampantly as in the
third quadra. The “descent” of the fourth quadra is akin to attainment
of security in old age: it’s comfortable, without sharp spikes, people
feel healthy and vigorous, thus the “descent” is almost imperceptible.
Still, the “descent” goes deeper and eventually leads to the agony -
abrupt disturbances in the usual rhythm of life and loss of interest in
the achievements of the past.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="central-and-peripheral">
<h3>Central and Peripheral<a class="headerlink" href="#central-and-peripheral" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>“CENTRAL” (second and third quadra). The periods of these quadra are
positioned in the middle in the overall macrocycle of social
development. These periods turn out to be the most eventful and most
expansive ones, and therefore attract much attention from the outside.
In them, the concentration of energy per unit of communicative space
reaches the highest values for a given society. For this reason, the
times of second and third quadra - are the most boisterous times in
history.</p>
<p>Common priorities of “central quadra” - are information aspects F and T
(Se and Ni), which in theory of socionics functions are interpreted as a
force component in communication and the aspect of change under the
influence of time, fatefulness. The fate of society is determined during
the “central” period of its history, and not at the beginning or the end
of its existence. It is the “central” sociotypes who are most
susceptible to suggestion - persuasion and uncritical adherence to any
program of external origin.</p>
<p>Even though representatives of both quadra inevitably fall into the
center of publicly significant events, still “centrality” as a sign of
more pronounced in the second quadra and not as much in the third. This
is connected with significant organizational talent of the sociotypes of
second quadra and their innate penchant for collective action within the
framework of strict discipline. Whatever the epoch is “outside”, but in
the center of any strong organizations in primary roles are people of
sociotypes from the second quadra.</p>
<p>Third quadra represents a kind of a center instability and anarchic
tendencies. More precisely, it is polycentric - it breaks down to
several local centers, that compete with each other. This quadra is much
better at using force in defense rather than offense and takeover. The
time of third quadra is usually characterized by the adjectives
“confusing, turmoiled”. It provides ground for the activities of various
fraudsters and impostors. Instead of the official religion of a society,
mystic and exotic cults gain popularity.</p>
<p>“PERIPHERAL” (first and fourth quadra). Shared priorities of these
quadra - are information aspects I and S (Ne and Si), i.e. free from
ideological mix-ins style of thinking, and comfortable, nonviolent,
harmonious with nature style of life. “Peripheral” sociotypes are not
inclined to fight for power, to expansion and competition, as much as
the “central” ones. They carry out their mission in the early onset of
social development or in his late completion, when the heat and the
passions of peak periods have already subsided or have not yet begun.</p>
<p>“Peripheral” sociotypes rarely occupy key positions in leadership, and
if they get them they don’t keep there for long. If it much harder for
“peripheral” sociotypes to become widely famous, to make an outstanding
career, to go down in history. Even when representatives of “peripheral”
quadra achieve something, success accompanies their activity only when
they are on the periphery of public attention: when they live quietly,
work informally, occupy ordinary positions.</p>
<p>If we compare the degree of “peripherality”, the fourth quadra ends up
being farther away from the center of attention. Fourth quadra is
opposite the second one, which is always the most likely contender for
the central positions. In addition, both of these quadra are
aristocratic, thus, it is understandable that their co-existence is
possible only when the leading positions are occupied by the second
quadra. Thus, fourth quadra types are still relegated to the periphery.</p>
<p>First quadra, as a whole, gets along better with the second one, since
it feeds it by its ideas. Second quadra leadership may even bring the
first quadra closer to itself. In a society, periodic shifts take place
from territorial margins to its center. At this time, someone from first
quadra can “slip by” and due to their unconventional ideas or
harmonious, non-destructive style of life take up a central position.</p>
<p>Each quadra can be defined as a commutative (not dependent on the order
of the traits) intersection of two dichotomous axes. The number of
combinations of three pairs of traits by two is equal to three. Thus, in
total there are three ways to geometrically build quadra with the use of
cross-shaped intersection of polar differentiating traits on a plane.
Here are these methods presented graphically:</p>

peripherally-ascendant “democrats”. For brevity, we refer to them

preparing the start of rapid social and psychological growth later time.</p>
<p>“Star” pervokvadralov always goes somewhere on the periphery. When this
is meant as a place periphery and periphery time. They used to refer to
the study of other phenomena that are only in the bud and does not
attract the attention of powerful and influential people of the moment.
A place that stimulates especially preparatory to think up brand new
possibilities of life of society - this crossroads run-ways and joints
conserved regions of the “sleeping” society.</p>
<p>Preparatory low energy potential, so their period there are only
temporary surges of public activity, which by themselves are not able to
withdraw from society symbiotic state of hibernation. However, the
energy is already beginning to slowly seep into every pore of a stable
society, step by step approaching a critical point. And then there is an
explosion: the curve of social dynamics rushes steeply upward, signaling
the beginning of a broad expansion of new forms of communication,
quickly displacing the old way. Time first impulse beyond the
preparatory quadra - it represents the transition to the second quadra.</p>
<p>Preparing ascent always going to be the democratic principles. While
still very far from the future triumph without also no guarantee that
this is the attempt to give healthy seedlings, a group of people united
not materialistic, and reminiscent of informal friendship ties. A group
of enthusiasts had time yet to be born direction does not need bosses,
combines in one person who directs, with those who obey. Hierarchy of
positions and titles of preparatory makes no sense.</p>
<p>The main outward sign sociotypes first quadra - a “childlike”, which is
easily detected in the expression of their faces, and in his eyes. Their
facial expressions trustful and direct, reflecting their underlying
emotional state. Various deviations from nature, tricks and attempts
wishful thinking so alien to them that sometimes completely “shut down”
of their communication or being forced to fence his world of inner
harmony of hypocrisy vnesheney environment impermeable membrane.</p>
<p>Pervokvadralov eyes see the world confidently and uncomplicated. They
have a double bottom, as reflected in their designs harmless. Even when
they get angry, their anger is not taken seriously. It seems that it is
simply passed over a small cloud that will soon dissipate and re-warm
sun shine. In the wide-open eyes they show their friendliness and
insecurity. From preparatory nobody expects serious danger, so harm them

Central ascending aristocrats. Their generic name implementers because
they like no other set plans for implementation in everyday life.
Energetically most powerful Quadra, implementers capable of reversing
the society.</p>
<p>Due to its activity and aggressiveness vtorokvadraly always hit the
center of any social dynamics. They especially rampant in government
activities, as well as in the sphere of ideology and culture. Main
carriers of “centrality” - a sociotypes Mentor and Marshall, who often
act in concert. No such problems conquest that would not resolved this
dangerous pair. They work well in the underground, creating illegal
centralized organizations.</p>
<p>implementers perfectly controlled directed energy flows. They are always
on the rise, they do not accept defeat in principle. They are easier to
kill yourself than to admit that their plans have the final collapse.
Second quadra very ideologichna: it doubles and triples its unifying
force due to their faith in the ideals for which they are able to
self-sacrifice. implementers so efficacious in implementation problems
because due to its emotional and volitional influence they involve
radical solution to problems large numbers of people. Quadra
implementers has extremely clannish nature. On a rigid hierarchy and
drawn strong hand kept their discipline. Irreconcilable division on
their own and others inevitably leads to ideologically and patriotically
colored wars. Two quadra will not rest until the build authoritarian
centralized state and destroy the opposition. Very typical for rulers
Voploiteley cult and national heroes. End of the second period is
characterized by the flourishing of quadra power of the state. At the
same time the transition to the next era - tretekvadralnomu period,
carrying with it the collapse of the state ideology and disorganization.</p>
<p>Representatives of the second quadra you learn externally by mimicry of
anger and intolerance that appears from time to time on their faces.
Their facial muscles as it adapted to the expression of superiority and
aristocratic election. Their gestures are either demanding, decisive, or
prim-cutesy, like everything they do has a “make or break” point. Since
they are compressed lips or eyebrows shift, issues inherent

gleam. It may be present constantly, and can dive to the bottom of the
eye, indicating that these are not the people with whom you can happily
joking. Sometimes the nature of the view changes to besstrasno-violent.

<p>By differentiating features tretekvadralnye sociotypes receive the
following characteristics: Central descending “democrats”. Their generic
name - Vibrators - emphasizes the side of their period of
macroevolution, which is associated with social instability,
clearly-vibrational character development, irrationality of life at this
time. Vibrators in different directions rocking mutual boat until it
falls apart into separate parts. Someone will survive, while others will
go to the bottom - this is the final vibrational period.</p>
<p>Vibrators Voplotitelyam like fighting for the central place in public
life, but they have other methods. If the second quadratic militarized
and reaches its mainly by force of arms, the third quadratic abhors war.
In the center of life, they are knocked out or economic or political
means. Vibrators able to earn money by trading and financial
speculation, they are great at negotiating and diplomatic tricks. Their
trump card - no guns, and the “golden calf”.</p>
<p>Since tretekvadraly produce its activities destructive vibration, that
is our continuing program moved to those areas of the communication
space, where there is left over from the previous period, resources and
energy, the time begins to degrade their collective as a whole. There is
a sharp decline of morals, removed almost all taboos come to the surface
the worst human instincts, starting with ending greed and perversion.
Vibrating period reminds one big cleaning or washing of the social
organism.</p>
<p>When dominated tretekvadraly crumbling discipline and any signs of
insubordination. Becoming allowed. Society is vaguely anarchic time,
recovery time and the new order in the band creeping lawlessness and
arbitrariness. Waves deteriorations and improvements overflowed man
undermine his faith in the future. Increases the number of suicides
occurring sharp stratification. Only at the end of this difficult period
is gradually being established civilized democratic forms of government.
An era of rebirth. But this is a transition to the fourth quadra.</p>
<p>Vibrator of the outward signs draw attention to themselves, some
features of their posture. For them quite characteristic short neck,
causing the impression that they draw his shoulders. Often also unusual
deflection body back, which leads to tilting the head forward and
protrusion of the abdomen. Their posture as if reflected across the
oscillatory nature quadra, generating a person “sea” ability to counter
roll.</p>
<p>Vibrator communication accompanies mimicry displeasure, which is read on
the lips and lower face. On the other hand, when the situation in their
favor, mimic signals change dramatically: there reaction smacking of
lips, winks. And guess what they like and what is not very difficult.
Often there is a negative development gives them a positive response and
positive news - discontent.</p>
<p>Something similar is also reflected in their eyes. Vibrator for
uncharacteristic depth look. Expression of the eyes varies from clear
interest in you to complete indifference to you and your information.
And the eyes attentive diagnostician pragmatism easily read their
desires. What benefits will I have with this? Their eyes are like the
lens focuses on the people, in which they see any benefit for himself.
They zapechetlen obschekvadralnaya philosophy: everything in this world

<h3>Fourth Quadra: LSE, IEE, EII, SLI - perfectors.<a class="headerlink" href="#fourth-quadra-lse-iee-eii-sli-perfectors" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Title sociotypes four quadra recruitment describing their
differentiating features - descending peripherally-aristocrats. With the
advent of time fourth quadra enters into force ideology of perfectionism
- bring to perfection, high-quality finishing. Perfector therefore mean
uplifters. In the era of the fourth quadra nothing new is created, but
is brought to perfection and completeness of all that survived the
previous period tretekvadralnoy cleaning.</p>
<p>Period of perfection devoid of globalism and grandeur. Perfector prefer
center offshoring. First, there is no perfection in the thick of things
when there is war or reform. Therefore, stable life in perfect public
forms distant in time from the revolutions and abrupt turns. Secondly,
life on the periphery always calmer than in the prestigious center where
eager and ambitious careerists. Perfection is not there, where there is
a show and the fight for the championship.</p>
<p>Perfectionists do not tend to intensify social life. Before them, and so
it was too violent and restless. With the advent of fourth quadra people
get a chance to rest and save his strength for the simple everyday life.
Oschestvo going through a phase of slow aging, politics and ideology no
one is interested, predatory war is not going to lead. Who works well,
does well and lives. No you do not push in the fight for ideals, no one
tore off you high taxes.</p>
<p>Aristocracy Perfector concluded basically that they do not want to deal
with violent and intrusive people. All those who can not make a living
on sound principles, they simply reject, consider themselves below the
level of development. They create their own small territory maintained a
comfortable life, and represents the interests of narrow specialization.
Therefore chetverokvadralnaya life devoid of urgency and passion. State
centralization minimal management is dispersed on a self-governing
territory of the middle scale.</p>
<p>Society fourth quadra slowly dying to a certain limit, beyond which
comes obscuration - blackout, every kind of loss of interest in life
until the complete dullness and inability to meet the basic instincts of
the body. This ends the period of perfectionism. Self-destruction leads
to the loss of special units of expanded reproduction and society is
being reshaped to form enclave that is symbiotic existence with nature.
And this is a transition in the first quadrupole - germ of a new life.</p>
<p>The most telling sign of the fourth quadra external manifestations -
this coldness of his eyes and expressionless facial expressions. The
smallest dose of extremeness in the outside world hurt hurt them, so
they destroy their critical communicative priority - ca</p>
<p>They accounted for a special destiny - to be perfected all
macroevolutionary cycle. And print sophistication and tired of life
embodied in all their characteristic appearance and manners. Perfector
look as healthy conservatives that life is little that need. Their
tastes and habits are far from the excesses and bombast. They prefer
low-key items, but quality. They too appreciate the emotional energy to
recklessly give it away to the right and to the left in the form of
passion, or at least lively gestures.</p>

<h2>One Turn of Quadral Estafette<a class="headerlink" href="#one-turn-of-quadral-estafette" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Analyzing the processes of transition from one socio-historical era to
another, I noticed that the elements of a new way of life spills out
immediately, one all-encompassing wave. Usually the period going to
replace the obsolete, deployed initially passive and hidden. From this
fact, I concluded that each period quadra relay begins with introverted
site.</p>
<p>And only after introverted work to penetrate the “pores” of the social
organism is done to the end, there is a bright flash of extroverted
activity was concentrated wafting all members of society to changing
priorities. And if at the initial stage of introverted quadra many still
doubt that the new rules will supersede the old, with the onset of the
last subperiod extroverted doubt the victory of reputation lifestyle
completely disappear.</p>
<p>Another fact that I noted in the analysis of the dynamics of the
historical process - is puzzling many people due to the fact that
seemingly reached a complete success and social texture suddenly very
quickly and gives a crack collapses before our eyes generations of his
followers. This means that people are confused flowering (akmaticheskuyu
phase) era with its finale that takes place in expansively extroverted.</p>
<div class="section" id="intraquadral-roles">
<h3>Intraquadral Roles<a class="headerlink" href="#intraquadral-roles" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>All this led me to construct a theory vnutrikvadralnoy turnover types -
quadra sweep. I am convinced that represent quadrupole as a gradual
increase in activity to a climax with its subsequent decline to a level
below the initial untrue. Quadra period is not a bright flash with dull
beginning and end, and a chain of two flashes separated introverted
subperiod stabilization.</p>
<p>Also after the second burst of activity followed by a sharp break quadra
quadra era and goes into oblivion. The second plot in extraverted quadra
is final - this is her last burst of energy, but many researchers
believe its climax than violate the logic of events: is there at the top
and not only the rise of descent?</p>
<p>Culmination of the present only the second plot: it is separated from
both sides introverted, quiet areas, indicating that its key provisions.
But the public consciousness for some reason does not keep up the
historical process. That’s when you need to operate at full capacity,
winning the maximum number of points of support in society, many workers
are just sleeping, waiting for better times. This is the cause of their
subsequent failures.</p>
<p>Thus, the whole quadra period should be divided into four sub-periods,
or stages, each of which has the character of one of the members of the
quadrupole sociotypes. And alternation types built on the principle of
an introvert extrovert replaced. If we ignore the projection quadra
relay on the dynamics of historical epochs, it is necessary to talk
about the four roles in the quadra that should be assigned to its four
sociotypes. What is this role?</p>
<p>The first role is performed sociotypes interrupting previous deployment
program quadra and sort it a piece of information that will serve as
seed capital for the native quadra. Let us call this role delousing.
Beginning of a new period proceeds always implicitly, so there can be
only delousing introvert. In addition to the delousing as type, standing
at the entrance quadra have the responsibility for compliance
verification of actions obschekvadralnoy program.</p>
<p>After skipping a quadrupole done, there is an intensive expansion quadra
priorities in all areas of society. Active role distribution quadra
values ??assumes one of extroverts quadra. By the end of the second
phase culminates with the entire period, so performing this role
sociotype called culminators. In culminators in emphatic form
concentrated all its advantages and disadvantages quadra.</p>
<p>Then, a feedback mechanism that adjusts the degree and direction
obschekvadralnoy activity. For the culmination should introverted
stabilization phase, during which the expansion is reduced, there is an
internal reallocation of resources. sociotype responsible for these
actions in the quadra called stabilizer. Stabilization subperiod gives
quadra “second wind”, preparing her for the final spurt.</p>
<p>Ends beautiful quadra and unexpected flash extroverted, during which
finally settled contradictions accumulated throughout the quadra period.
sociotype performing sprint is called Finalist. Last shot quadra spawns
many illusions about the inviolability of proven orders. With the
collapse of hope and transformation processes are started, which
resulted in the quadra “throws a bridge” to the other side - his
smenschitsy. Therefore Finalist - is both a type mezhkvadralnogo
transition.</p>
<p>If we arrange vnutrikvadralnye steps in chronological order, then line
up the following chain of successive roles:</p>
<p>Gatekeepers - Culminators - Stabilizers - Finalists.</p>

<div class="section" id="natural-causes-energy-conservation">
<h3>Natural causes - energy conservation<a class="headerlink" href="#natural-causes-energy-conservation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>In nature, in which global conservation laws, according to which there
is no perpetual motion and any development has two opposite directions,
based on the exchange of energy between them when it left unchanged,
within a broader system.</p>
<p>With the development in the first direction is a waste of energy, by
which the developing system stronger and more complicated. This upward
development, it is due to the fact that elsewhere in the system is
simplified and some splits, giving its internal energy fledgling
organization. Reached its highest growth, the first system in turn
starts to degrade, pumping energy is released in the next place, etc.
This downward development.</p>
<p>The second circumstance global law of energy is that each system in a
given time interacts at least with the other two systems. In other
words, it has its predecessor, which is powered by and formed, as well
as his successor, for which acts as the energy donor herself. Formed
ternary sequence “thesis antithesis - synthesis” or “subsystem - system - the super-system.”</p>
<p>And finally, she is confronted by equal in strength, but with the
opposite sign (orthogonal) system, with which it annihilates -
destroying each other, highlighting the free energy. It is due to the
latter kind of interaction in the communicative space is always a free
energy. Due to this excess energy and vortex method originate more new
spiral quadra. Hence the conclusion that macroevolution is on converging
spiral. After all, without ever closer contact antipodes did not occur
to energy-dissipating annihilation. Identified four phases of energy in
physics oscillatory processes are called potential energy, the
transition of potential energy into kinetic energy, kinetic energy and
the return of the kinetic energy into potential energy. These phases are
legitimate in nature universal. Think of the annual rhythm (spring,
winter, summer, autumn), the daily rhythm (morning, afternoon, evening,
night), periodization of human life (childhood, youth, maturity, old
age). It is these phases correspond quadra periods. They have
essentially phased attenuation initial hesitation, swung due to the
annihilation of energy transfer.</p>

<div class="section" id="demographic-reasons-population-density">
<h3>Demographic reasons - population density<a class="headerlink" href="#demographic-reasons-population-density" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>More specific language community macroevolution live specimens can be
explained by the effects of changes in population density, inhabiting
rendered habitable territory. Starting position is a residence on the
territory of the number of individuals that exactly matches the
capabilities of the environment to feed the population without much
damage to themselves. When dynamic equilibrium number of individuals who
were born on average equal to the number of deaths, so such a symbiotic
population does not increase, but not decrease. Occur only minor
fluctuations population, which, however once lead to the fact that
one-half of the total area of ??the excess of births over deaths ends
flash exponential population growth.</p>
<p>Resources of the natural environment in this part of the population is
not enough, therefore dramatically sharpened the struggle for existence.
Stronger individuals displace weaker. Increases the concentration of
active and aggressive members of the community on the upper floors of
communicative hierarchy which redistribute limited natural resources in
their favor, selecting them from the repressed to the lower level of
existence relatives. In parallel with this process, the dominant part of
the population forcibly seizes living on the territory of the old order
of individuals and distributes them to its inequities.</p>
<p>However, the vertical stratification of the population does not solve
the problem fundamentally limited livelihood. By the end of the second
phase of the population reaches a concentration of features, then there
are two types of confrontational war: the oppressed against their
masters, as well as newcomers against natives. The entire community is
split into warring factions, destroying each other fiercely. By the end
of the third phase of the excess population is more than eliminated, and
killed most socially active figures. Population gradually calms down.
Population growth stops because in the era of internecine clashes there
is a significant drop in living standards and few among the impoverished
population at risk start a large number of children. People think of
daily survival, not for heirs murky unknown future. Having children is
delayed until later - to peace and acquisition comfortable living
conditions. However, when the strife and turmoil subside, population
numbers have never recovered because the birth rate is slowly but
steadily declining. Parents do not need a lot of children, because in a
stable phase, they can count on guaranteed a secure old age. And educate
children because of increased demands for material security is becoming
harder and harder. Population therefore returns to self-sustaining
balance of births and deaths, that is, in the first phase.</p>

<h3>Economic reasons - labor productivity<a class="headerlink" href="#economic-reasons-labor-productivity" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Classics of Marxism at the forefront change of socio-economic formations
predict factor productivity. According to their theory, when the
existing formation ceases to satisfy demand growth in production
efficiency, it becomes a drag on the economy and is coming from the
historical arena, giving way to a more progressive way of.</p>
<p>Marx’s theory of the development of society through five socio-economic
formations is consistent with the concept of the socionics quadra.
However, analysis of the evolution quadra does an exceptional emphasis
on economic reasons. Basic and superstructural phenomena in society are
equal and can not be argued that the first defines the second. Social
consciousness is equivalent to its force being exerted.</p>
<p>First quadra corresponds in its basic communicative characteristics of
tribal formation. At the preparatory norm is precisely the family
atmosphere of dialogue: a relaxed and informal, as between brothers and
sisters. Authority in this quadra not be won by force or wealth, and
personal experiences and knowledge. Labor productivity in the
preparatory low, there is no organizational types with F or producing P.</p>
<p>Living in non-violent manner and in harmony with the environment,
pervokvadraly not need in government. They have no class division of
society and, as their lowly requests fully satisfies egalitarian
distribution of wealth. Their own quadra preparer can somehow settle on
any portion of unspoilt nature.</p>
<p>Communicative features are very similar to the second quadra feudal
system. It is a power and heroic Quadra, which is waging a war exists
only in aristocratic forms. implementers create class society with rigid
class barriers. Normal form of government they have - it’s an absolute
monarchy. Religion or ideology in general has in this quadra precedence
over science. Dissent is eliminated as erodes public order.</p>
<p>Production in the second quadra built on non-economic methods of
coercion producers of wealth. Business logic P is not included in the
kit voplotitelskih regulators, but rather revered strength and power -
aspect F. Commodity production virtually no trade exists in the form of
barter products. A large proportion of the gross national product goes
to the maintenance of the army and state apparatus branched.</p>
<p>Capitalist formation - this is the era of the third quadra, vibration.
Instead of the power of coercion in this quadra included economic
incentives. Production is regulated by market mechanisms, there is no
centralized control. Dominated by commodity-money relations, everything
can be bought and sold. Production is not the individual, as in the
second quadra and massive. Vtorokvadralnye class mixed together.</p>
<p>During tretekvadralnogo capitalism observed rise in elective politics
and democratic forms. Form of government is gradually acquiring a
bipartisan nature. The government is staying alternately left-centrist
(social democratic, tax increases and this bill strengthening Social
Security), then right-centrist (liberal, reduce taxes and encourage
increased profits due to production) party and the radicals and
extremists (active supporters of the second quadra) have political
weight.</p>
<p>Communist formation, which has not yet been realized, and many do not
believe in its reality, nevertheless agrees well with the communicative
priorities fourth quadra. Perfector for revealing the highest
productivity (PS - the most productive type in socion) in this quadra
people live the abundance of material goods. Productive accumulation is
not being spent on the war, bloated bureaucracy, grandiose project of
the century. Blurs the distinction between town and country. Cities
monsters, these wreck nature works the third quadra lose appeal.</p>
<p>In the minds of the people approved the principles of humanism and
tolerance. Emotions and passions fade into the background, people are
guided by a calm and respectful relationship. No crime, no one
encroaches on the property of another. Political struggle few people are
interested, all problems are solved locally by local authorities.
Honesty and hard work is not based on some mythical consciousness
(Perfector - the same people with their weaknesses, as well as other
types of quadra), and at the elementary reluctance to interfere, disrupt
tradition. Perfector live maximum use of each unit of energy and spend
it on destructive acts will not.</p>
<p>Apart from the four analyzed my main socio-economic systems, there is
also the intermediate corresponding to transitions between quadra
periods. Slave system - is the transition from the first to the second
quadra: it combines the democratic forms of government with power
operation, bold advances in science with the dominance of the religious
worldview.</p>
<p>Between feudalism and capitalism arose not allocated as an independent
science in between traditional social structure that is logically called
postfeodalnoy community. It is about the Cossack settlements in which
military force forms of life intertwine with free commodity production
the third quadra. Such a form of social life is not complete mandatory
step in changing economic structures, as well as slavery.</p>
<p>The transition from the third to the fourth quadra generates the
intermediate mode, which could be called socialism, referring not so
much his Soviet as the Swedish model. Under socialism, the role of
public authorities is quite significant, because somebody has to
redistribute wealth in favor of the weaker, but labor productivity
should not suffer from the fact that there is a significant layer of not
seek</p>
<p>It is possible that in a more global way the transition to a quadra
uplifters is a so-called post-industrial society, in which almost the
contradiction between capital and labor: owners of large states
voluntarily deduct a portion of their income to the needs of science,
culture and social benefits. Developed computer communications allow you
to participate in the production of material and information without
leaving their places of residence. All this - the periphery elements
inherent Perfector.</p>

<div class="section" id="historical-reasons-passionate-impulse">
<h3>Historical reasons - passionate impulse<a class="headerlink" href="#historical-reasons-passionate-impulse" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Convincing picture of the historical development of ethnic groups
sketched LNGumilev author ethnogenesis theory [2]. However, he explains
protsiskhozhdenie initial push ethnic cosmo-biological factors - special
micromutations in humans, occurring under the influence of cosmic
radiation. It is difficult to agree that the level of social
communication space is reduced to the phenomena of the physical order.
But whatever it was, Gumilev introduced the concept of drive, as the
driving force of the history of peoples perfectly conveys the
relationship of micro-and makrosotsiuma, man and society, are the
subject of Socionics.</p>
<p>LNGumilev distinguishes between three types of individuals according to
their degree of drive, which is the ability to give their psychic energy
not selfish, and obscheetnicheskie purpose. First, it passionary
individuals who sacrifice themselves for the sake of the business, and
secondly, it subpassionate who are not able to suppress my baser
instincts, and harmonious people whose energy is distributed
approximately equally between personal and public.</p>
<p>From the point of view of socionics passionarnost most similar to the
communicative aspect of the T - dependence on fate, missionary work,
sacrifice, detachment from earthly things. Subpassionarnost - it’s the
same aspect, but taken with the opposite sign. Therefore, directly
related to the actions passionarnym sotsionicheskie groups are central
quadra. Most Passionary implementers quadra and most quadra
subpassionarna Vibrator. Peripherals are Passionary quadra-neutral, or,
if we take on Gumilev consist of harmonious individuals.</p>
<p>The first phase of ethnogenesis - this initial shove collecting
passionary personalities in one place and provides a rise of a new
ethnic group that creates the state and expands its habitat due to
conquest and absorption of other, weaker ethnic groups. By the end of
the total phase of the lift comes akmaticheskaya phase - the flowering
of the ethnic group, the time of his greatest power.</p>
<p>Akmaticheskuyu phase unexpectedly but naturally replaces phase fracture.
During this period the collapse of the empire, there were bloody clashes
intraethnic raging civil war. Ethnicity shock vibrations of drive
opposite signs. Surplus energy is spent on destroying passionaries each
other, and part with drive leaves the nation and populates vacant land.</p>
<p>After fracture ethnicity expects inertial phase - a period of slow
consumption remaining stocks passionate energy. This phase is called
civilization historians because ethnicity live in it peacefully and
prosperously, accumulates a large amount of material culture products
and leaves a lot of written sources.</p>
<p>Following the coming phase inertial obscuration - the agony of drive,
loss of orientation and goal setting in general, chaotic turnover
priorities, decomposition and degradation of ethnicity to the most
primitive forms. Dying ethnicity may actually disappear because of
assimilation - traceless dissolution among younger people, and may
become a relic. Relic ethnicity will exist indefinitely, while in
homeostasis with the environment, or give rise to a new ethnic group.</p>
<p>Thus, the scheme is slightly different from ENU our order of the quadra
phases. Etnogenez Gumilev begins with quadra implementers, followed
quadra Vibrator and perfector, and death ethnicity accounted for
quadrupole preparer. It should be noted that the beginning of an ethnic
movement Gumilev explains not earthly and cosmic causes, so preparatory
macroevolution in the world to him were not needed. Yet he described as
a relic of the first quadratic and have the generator mutations of
products which implementers and create their unifying and spiritualize
the idea.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the arrangement of quadra according to Gumilev
suggests that a rectangular projection on the plane turn quadra
incompletely reflects the true relations between the periods. Much
closer to reality volume model, which has the geometric shape of a
tetrahedron.</p>
<p>If we compare with each of the four tetrahedron faceted one quadra (this
must be attributed to the triple form a face value corresponding edges
differentiating features), then one of them will act as a base. Outside
communicative space is irrelevant, what is at the bottom of the quadra.
But in the real historical process as a fulcrum acts as a first time
quadrature, which therefore is perceived background macroevolutionary
spiral rotation axis.</p>

<h3>Socionic reasons - social order<a class="headerlink" href="#socionic-reasons-social-order" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Clean socionical cause quadra relay makes sense to consider asymmetrical
mezhkvadralnye ties that still dosotsionicheskih studies called social
order. The basis of symmetry breaking is the division of all living
forms of nature and society on the left and right modification. Most
researchers are of the opinion that it is the left-right asymmetry, not
occurring in inorganic matter, hides a secret of the origin of life [3].
Quadra in its structure is the formation of non-equilibrium, one of the
components of its dual pairs of polarized, and the second, following it - left polarized. It is for this reason that the period has quadra
dvupikovy rather than the single peak dates. Because the left and right
halves of the quadra pulled in opposite directions, there is the
potential difference which is holding back, then pushes quadra
deployment program. Through this internal mechanism bootstrapping one
quadra behind the average pace, and the other, on the contrary,
accelerated, taking the place of the outsider, if the natural and social
environmental conditions require a different method of adaptation.
Social order plays the role of an external force to choose between two
alternatives the one that best fits into the altered communicative
space.</p>
<p>Social order internally chain stitch all quadra inversely proportional
relationship. The stronger transmitter works, the lower the activity of
the receiver. Conversely, the weaker become the impulses coming from the
transmitter, the receiver is more activated. Thus, the internal clash of
right-and levoorientirovannyh processes enable or disable deployment
speed quadra programs that provide a total displacement mechanism
obsolete communicative paradigm of its neighbor-rival.</p>
<p>implementers supersede social arena conditioner in his strength and
organization. Preparatory give rise to vague and distant goal, but can
not do anything for their implementation. To overcome passivity and
primitive interests of the majority of the population, need energy and
ability to get people to face the force of the new. To agitate and
organize the masses can only second quadra. Preparatory just come to
Voplotitelyam themselves at the service to be able to stably organized
and doing things you love.</p>
<p>Vibrators displace implementers its pluralism and efficiency. Suppress
or even eliminate dissent, why so eager second quadra, it is impossible
in principle. Removing bounding boxes can be due to natural competition
and selfishness of people achieve better meet the needs of society. This
makes the third quadra, shifting the focus from coercion on the material
interest. Just buy vibrators implementers than make split their once
powerful ranks.</p>
<p>Perfector coming to replace vibrator being pushed by their humanity and
quality of life. In an era vibrating badly people get tired of
instability, corruption of politicians, low-quality goods, the pursuit
of short-term profit. Good attitude to man can do more than financial
reward. Reliance on healthy tradition, confidence in the future - that’s
what your change Vibrators liberalism and commercialism.</p>
<p>Preparatory, vospryanuvshie spirit between perfectionism take over the
baton from the hands of the fourth thanks to its quadra intellectualism
and enthusiasm. Conservatism and traditionalism stable, unfortunately,
quite easily bored, people want variety and strangeness. Grounding and
pessimism tired of life perfectors not compete with the enthusiasm and
intelligent search preparer.</p>
<p>That’s so multifaceted, but at the same time making its way purposefully
quadra relay, each type is indispensable contribution to the overall
process. Many benefits for themselves would benefit the intellectual
forces of society, if taken into account in its activities quadra system
timing. Constructible where you started and where its development are
now, think and vote on new habits and aspirations of their friends and
enemies. This will help you to understand what awaits you in the future,
as well as, perhaps, make your way to the goal shorter.</p>
