<h2>Communication on channels 1 - 5: Program functions Ne of ILE and Si of SEI<a class="headerlink" href="#communication-on-channels-1-5-program-functions-ne-of-ile-and-si-of-sei" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Program function (function goals and objectives) of ILE, “intuition of
possibilities”, “intuition prospects.”</div>
<div class="line">Don - Quixote - the ingenious inventor, tireless researcher, an
optimist, a dreamer, a dreamer. Its mission - to generate ideas,
develop projects, to open new horizons in science.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Program of SEI - “sensory experiences”.</div>
<div class="line">Dumas - down to earth realist, oriented to the most natural human
values. Gorgeous family man, thrifty and economical. Its mission - to
create for your Douala and “maturing” ideas most greenhouse
conditions.</div>
</div>
<p>So Dumas can be not only the mastermind Don - Quixote, but great “to
cover his rear.” As practice shows, hardly once in a dual environment of
comfort, Don - Quixote already beginning to generate ideas (ie their
right to engage in business) - ponders his future occupation, makes the
calculation of its future business, budget, etc.). For its part, adds
Don Dumas - Quixote as a great mediator in all cases. It presents the
flexible ethics and diplomatically sensitive “sensory experiences”,
which allows a very good feel of the interlocutor.</p>
<p>Of course such coherence does not occur immediately - it takes time and
experience relationships to duals believe in each other, coordinated
their policy values, developed general guidelines common tastes …</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">- And tastes too? - Says Reader.</div>
<div class="line">- Do not forget that in this aspect of the dyad “sensory experiences”
- “soft” value, and therefore is of great importance for both
partners.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">For example, and Don - Quixote may be unhappy with the comfort that it
creates Dumas: “She eternal blockages in the bathroom and in the
kitchen … And then, I do not like her cooking. “Herring under a fur
coat,” as far as I know, so do not do it. Anyway, my mom’s cooking on
- another … “- here is an example of suggestibility Don. For him,
the standard is what he used and what he brought. His tastes have been
formed, they are important to him and to change them he was not going.
- Well, it’s the little things, you will think, “herring” … And do
not happen here any more serious complications for the programmatic
aspect?</div>
<div class="line">- Cases. And here is an example. In young dual pair (he - Don, she -
Dumas) had some problems: their sexual relationship is not something
that went wrong - have become too monotonous …</div>
<div class="line">- And sex - it is important, it is a manifestation aspect of sensory
sensations … programmatic aspects in this dyad.</div>
<div class="line">- … It is not surprising that the young husband very quickly felt a
touch uncomfortable, worried and began to think about how to fix
things. (That is, the program began to adjust its duala.) Hearing that
in such cases, sexologists recommend changing partner, he was carried
away (inspire) this idea and tried to convince my wife to try this
“therapeutic agent”.</div>
<div class="line">- And his wife did not try to dissuade him?</div>
<div class="line">- I tried, but it came to nothing lead, so she decided to let the
spouse requests. Besides, she was sure of myself and believed that
sufficient control of the situation.</div>
<div class="line">- And how it went, “treatment”? - Ironically reader.</div>
<div class="line">- For the wife - is easy and painless: nothing new for yourself and
she opened her tastes have not changed. But her husband with a random
partner began a very complex and problematic relationship
(“relationship sotszakaza”), of which he was its own is no longer
extricate himself.</div>
<div class="line">- And it happens that Dumas inspired ideas and projects Don - Quixote?</div>
<div class="line">- Often, but not everything here depends on the “suggestion”
(suggestion). It happens that some of his projects duala Dumas
estimates as unrealistic. It already includes the evaluation function
Dumas - structural logic. If the projects Don - Quixote (software
feature - “intuition of possibilities and prospects” do not correspond
to the actual conditions or refuted actual facts - Dumas do not
believe them. And has every right - he is a realist. And that it
balances romance and visionary Don - Quixote.</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="communication-on-channels-2-6">
<h2>Communication on channels 2 - 6<a class="headerlink" href="#communication-on-channels-2-6" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Relationships channel (2 - 6) (trial - realization function) Each dual
dyad “aligned” for very long. It depends on how well the program is
implemented and how it assesses partner. And since success here can
alternate with setbacks - changes accordingly “evaluation” partner
change and its relation to this aspect. Partner that is inspired, it
becomes inert. (By the way that “evaluation” function it is also the
“activation”.)</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">- And as Don Quixote Dumas assesses emotion? (An aspect of “ethics of
emotions) After this aspect also lies on channel 2 - 6?</div>
<div class="line">- The channel (2 - 6), as already mentioned, formed the psychological
distance partners. Therefore, emotionally aligned relationship is here
for years, and especially in this dyad. Partners of alternate periods
of emotional uplift, love with some periods of cooling and alienation.
In addition, if Don - Quixote raising ethical issues, (and they
usually start with the fact that it “puts” on the aspect of the
“ethics of emotions” by inert - activation function), it loses the
ability to control their behavior. Moreover, it may behave
unpredictably: constantly annoyed by trifles, indulge in aggression;
becomes overly frank, verbose and intrusive. And he is constantly
experiencing a terrible embarrassment, remorse and shame. In such a
situation it becomes absolutely necessary person capable of it
patiently listen, understand, forgive, comfort, soothe, relax. And
this is exactly what can perfectly handle his dual Dumas, provided
that does not feel any emotional overload.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">- What’s that?</div>
<div class="line">- Dumas by nature very calm and peaceful person. He is a very bad
feeling in the atmosphere of hostility, stress and turmoil. Therefore,
in a situation “with a random partner” wife was extremely difficult to
listen to “confession” of her husband in all the intimate details. In
addition, she was very afraid that this relationship can resume. In
short, she had no way to create it in a good mood and emotional
balance it. Not have the strength to implement its program.</div>
<div class="line">- But this story have a happy ending?</div>
<div class="line">- History “finished” again on an aspect of the disorder “sensory
experiences” - all these experiences affected the health of his wife.
It hurt a lot and for a long time, as a result of hormonal disorders
very stout, so they were both not to sex - that is, they are back to
the same problems.</div>
<div class="line">- But Dumas is in its nature an “artist in love,” why they had
problems on the program function?</div>
<div class="line">- Sexual problems in the couple began after their relationship went
wrong channel (3 -7) and (4 - 8). And here’s the kind of history:</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="communication-on-channels-3-7-and-4-8">
<h2>Communication on channels 3 - 7 and 4 - 8<a class="headerlink" href="#communication-on-channels-3-7-and-4-8" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>When - is hardly acquainted, this young couple very quickly and easily
dualized. Already on the second day of dating they decided to get
married. The first few years they have all been good, they lived
peacefully and happily. All of them turned out, all problems were solved
easily and successfully. In the short time they bought an apartment, a
car, had a baby, her husband succeeded in business - that is, everything
was wonderful. But one day the situation has changed dramatically: they
moved to permanent residence close relatives of her husband. Total
number - four. And one and all - representatives of the second quadra.</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">- And what’s wrong with that?</div>
<div class="line">- And the fact that the “second squared”, she did not “moved” - it is
implemented to overcome the resistance of the environment. Also, do
not accidentally second quadrupole called “quadra violent bestow
happiness” - they always impose their recipe “Family Happiness,” which
is sometimes reduced to the commandment: “let the wife fear her
husband.” That’s really it does not fit into the peaceful, dual
relationship of our heroes, where all based on equality, mutual
respect and love. Thus, in their quiet and cozy, “pervokvadrovy”
microcosm broke “vortices hostile” second quadra, with its cruel laws
and authoritarian values.</div>
<div class="line">- And how it affected our dual pair?</div>
<div class="line">- And here’s how: what passed - and while young husband to please
parents began to “play the role of” husband - a tyrant. And this role
is very carried away.</div>
<div class="line">- That is, the beginning of “excesses” in his “role-aspect” aspect to
“strong-willed sensory” …</div>
<div class="line">- … He became the wife defiantly slight, overwork, and she has, of
course, was not up to the “Arts” in bed. Worse, in their home started
“willful” distribution of responsibilities: “You have to do what you
have to do it.” That is, in their dual pair established a completely
unnatural relationship, the nature of Don nasty - Quixote. Normal,
oriented to their natural values ??Don - Quixote in principle does not
accept this division of responsibilities - in his opinion, everyone
has the right to do what he wants, what can and what it sees fit. And
what usually happens in a harmonious dual dyads, but here the harmony
was broken.</div>
<div class="line">- What happened?</div>
<div class="line">- Discord on its normative aspect was reflected on her role function
(Channel 3 -7 aspect “intuition of time”), its troubled question of
how long will this demonstrative tyranny? And how does this affect her
relationship with her husband? Here’s a “forecast” it became “request”
for the future (and who is, and respond to it as not Don - Quixote!),
A perennial plant conversation on the topic: “What will happen to us?”
But received no reply - position them both seemed hopeless. Her
husband, moreover, he considered disadvantageous to part with their
relatives, and yet afraid to offend them (Don ethical problems -
Quixote combined with demonstrative pragmatism (Channel 4 - 8).
Relatives on the contrary - to feel themselves masters of the
situation, began to actively intriguing tune young against each other.</div>
<div class="line">- And what is the end of it?</div>
<div class="line">- One day, my husband came home from work found no wife, no child, but
found a note on the table, in which he was asked to either find a way
to part with their relatives or to seek another wife.</div>
<div class="line">That same evening, held an emergency meeting in the kitchen. Relatives
realized that their “game” went too far, husband realized that strayed
too far from their natural values. In short, during the day was found
apartment for relatives, and everything fell into place. Wife returned
to her husband, but in their relationship there was some estrangement
… - Which led to the disorder of their sexual relationship …</div>
<div class="line">- If only the fact that they were sleeping under different blankets
(remembered as the young wife, it started with this disorder in their
relationship - and the sexual and ethical …)</div>
<div class="line">- And this is essential!</div>
<div class="line">- And how! Especially for duals. Because in this case the broken ties
bioenergetic the vital level, which is particularly dangerous. On the
mental level in duals can be all sorts of differences, but if we want
to save the relationship, not destroy them, it must be vital soldered.
And it needs to constantly feel physically intimate partner,
especially during sleep, especially when the subconscious liberated.</div>
<div class="line">- It turns out that double blanket - this medicine number 1.</div>
<div class="line">- For duals - yes. And it is this “medicine” and was “spelled” Don -
Quixote in order to bring it under the influence of “random partner.”
Physical intimacy Duala, his vital field - proved the best remedy for
this.</div>
<div class="line">- And why - the same dual partner so weak willed resisted pressure
from her husband? Indeed, in this pair she is the sensation, so where
is her willpower, where is it will sensorics?</div>
<div class="line">- Her “volitional sensing” in their positions - the positions of
inert, analytical, supervisory functions, which is also located at the
ID - at the level of “reckless self-sacrifice.”</div>
<div class="line">- That is, its task is to “watch” and “sacrifice” themselves?</div>
<div class="line">- Up to a certain point. Observation “will sensorics” Dumas is not
designed for serious battles too - it’s not her mode. It is designed
for a maximum to divert “sparkle” Don - Quixote of the “war on
windmills.” And here it happened that Don Quixote fought with his
dualom at least was with him “on opposite sides” that quite worthless.</div>
<div class="line">- And how do you explain the fact that “Don” so “played in the
afternoon” in its role function? Than he is so fond of the mask
“despot.” After all, his strong-willed efforts are usually directed to
the good and noble deeds.</div>
<div class="line">- If Don - Quixote gets education in the second quadra it “will
sensorics” except that becomes negative, (different aggressiveness,
authoritarianism), and it exacerbates the ethical issues it becomes
almost the highest value, competes with its program intuition. In this
case, “Don”, as it were accumulating “subtype” or Maxim Zhukov. Such
“Don - Quixote” is more appropriate and “Dumas”, brought up in the
same conditions and on the same values ??- that is a very strong,
powerful and strong-willed partner. And although Dumas is not the most
attractive quality - but you never know where, to whom and under what
conditions is useful that you believe is your fault. Want an example?</div>
<div class="line">- Of course!</div>
<div class="line">- One no longer young and very unlucky “Don Quixote” (“to the type” -
“Yesenin”), after many failures in his personal life meets a
twenty-girl “Dumas” very highly developed sensory volitional
(“subtype” - “Zhukov” ). And imagine, quickly and conveniently with
her Dualizing. (Coincidence “subtypes”: “Zhukov” and “Yesenin” - also
duals). A week after meeting they begin to live together; he stops
drinking, establishes life, gets a job - in short, all of them well.
And most importantly - their dual relationship stabilized surprisingly
fast: it took only two months, but he already feels calm, balanced,
peaceful - in short, dualized. Girl holding it in the “rod of iron”,
but imagine it like it (though, of course, he is a little afraid of
her.) But at least she had good discipline and he to her for that.
Cherishes his relationship with her.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">- But Don - Quixote - it is usually highly intelligent, erudite
people, and by your example of why - it is not clear …</div>
<div class="line">- Very well, here’s another example of dualization: husband - Don -
Quixote, intellectual, scholar; wife - Dumas, beautiful, confident
woman, athlete (hobby - karate); two children. But the family idyll
they lasted only eleven years …</div>
<div class="line">- Well, it’s a lot, but what then?</div>
<div class="line">- And then the happy husband was involved in what - that religious
sect - just became involved, of curiosity. (From Don - Quixote it
happens - the software “intuition of possibilities” often leads to
their religiosity, thinking about making any irrational and anomalous
phenomena.) Wife, accustomed to respect intellectual interests of her
husband, his new interests perceived quietly, but when this passion
began to take pathological - cringed. When he tried to involve
children in the sect - actively protested and even used force. (As
told by her coach karate for her one stroke put three men - a piece of
cake.) When her husband brought home a bottle of poison and announced
that it was time to prepare the children to move into the “better
world”, she decided to further him living dangerously, took her
children and divorced immediately.</div>
<div class="line">- And she was not sorry to destroy the family, break a relationship
with him? after all - still duals?</div>
<div class="line">- Especially her act deserves respect! After all, it makes the most
overriding values ??- children’s lives. For Dumas, there can be
nothing more valuable.</div>
<div class="line">- But it has survived at least friendly relations with the former
spouse, or he was moved to a “better world”?</div>
<div class="line">- The former spouse is alive and well, and the relationship they have
- so-so. Anyway, child support, he refuses to pay.</div>
<div class="line">- And what he is motivated?</div>
<div class="line">- However, it is not his children, and “God’s”, so let God take care
of them and - typical bravado and vindictiveness offended Don -
Quixote, combined with pragmatism and logical demonstrative
resourcefulness.</div>
<div class="line">- But maybe he was not going to slack off? And just trying to impress?</div>
<div class="line">- “Sparkle on” volitional sensorike “, you mean? Possible. Don -
Quixote extravagance peculiar behavior, but at least now he knows what
you have to pay for the minute posturing. In addition, normal,
oriented to their natural values ??Don - Quixote knows that you can
play anything but not the lives of their children.</div>
<div class="line">- And this passion delusions that stupid stubbornness, how to
understand?</div>
<div class="line">- It’s okay. Don - Quixote obliged to defend their ideas, and who will
do it for him? If only ideas deserved …</div>
<div class="line">- And the fact that he was so unethical cost-friendly? …</div>
<div class="line">- Average manifestation problematic don - kihotovskoy ethics. Just in
this situation, he felt very uncomfortable, because no ethical support
from the partner is not received.</div>
<div class="line">(Otherwise, it could not be - too deep were hurt its interests …</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">- And, by the way, what is shown here support duals on mobilization
aspects? This channel of communication we have not yet considered …
(refers to a channel (4 - 8), aspects of “the ethics of relations” at
the Don and the “business logic” Dumas.)</div>
<div class="line">- Demonstrative compassion and peacefulness Dumas, his ability to give
a soft and sincere tone of any conversation, his touching care and
boundless love for children - this is what sets Don - Quixote on the
most benevolent way. And although Don - Quixote and some peculiar
“prickliness” and “aggressive” - ??yet he adopts a friendly tone Dumas
becomes kinder, more tolerant and more delicate, lighter and
communicate freely surf the complex ethical situations.</div>
</div>
<p>At the same time, and takes over from Don Dumas - Quixote necessary
business skills: bolder displays business initiative, shows ingenuity,
inventiveness, achieves high results in their work. Dumas is always
proud of their labor achievements, but no matter how others evaluate his
work, the main praise, support and encouragement he expects to recover
it from your co-player. It is very important for him.</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">- And he gets it?</div>
<div class="line">- If the relationship develop peacefully and safely, if Don - Quixote
no significant claims for touch and ethical issues, and then about his
successes partner responds with great respect. (“Here, it is now
promoted to the post, a separate study identified may soon salary
increase. Have it done!”). But if you still brewing what - that claim
(and they are usually expressed in the form of nitpicking) dualu
recollected all his flaws as an aspect of the business logic: and his
“worthlessness” and sluggishness, and the desire to shirk hard work
and fear of physical overload: “It seems that it is more than all the
works, it is more than all the complains of fatigue. Although, I do
not see where it recycles it … “(His wife works two jobs, pulling a
half rate, fumbling with toddler and he does not” see “where she was
so tired. Incidentally, these claims were presented again same spouse
sexually satisfied: “She complains that she is tired and she at me,
you see, is not strong enough! ..”)</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">- Surely it said Don - Quixote, very serious quarrel with his wife …</div>
<div class="line">- … And maybe so, against the advice, he had a desire to get more of
her work. To which she immediately responded demonstrative aggravation
of relations: know, they say that you are offended. In response to her
grievance, he further tightened its requirements. (That is, on the
aspects of the problem “volitional sensing” and “ethics of relations”
… And this is exacerbated by all aspects of the level of the
superego - the most painful for Don - Quixote.)</div>
<div class="line">- And what is the solution? - Worried reader. - How are they now?</div>
<div class="line">- Now it all depends on will the Dumas defending their positions and
sensory and ethically will the strong-willed to resist the pressure of
Douala will the smooth the conflict … In my opinion, should not be
taken seriously for a caricature of “tyranny” Don - Quixote-fact it’s
just a “game”.</div>
<div class="line">- But maybe if Don - Quixote - woman and Dumas - man dualization
proceeds more safely? By the way, who in this case has to deal with
the economy?</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">- Who wants to, he is engaged. As in any irrational dual pair there is
no strict separation of duties.</div>
<div class="line">Needless to say, the girls - Don - Quixote is not peculiar to prepare
yourself Housewives: “Not for seven years I studied at the university,
to the whim of what - what idiot life stand at the stove! ..” - Said
one of the representatives of this sociotypes. Incidentally this is a
charming and well-educated woman, thinking about marriage has always
represented at the stove with her future husband, (herself she had
only seen on the computer.) After numerous attempts to find your ideal
in Russia, it spread to the Western Hemisphere, where nearly married
an American. Fortunately, just making out that she awaits the fate
again Housewives, she terminated the engagement, returned to the groom
a ring with diamonds and returned home. Here she went to a
psychologist to clarify what was happening to her: “Either with me
that - something is wrong, or the terms of some idiots, I do not
understand …”</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">- What is there to understand? normal girl! She just has not had the
opportunity to meet her co-player … And it’s really a problem for
women Don - Quixote?</div>
<div class="line">- Recall aspect “sensory experiences” is in their position suggestive
function (at the “absolute weakness”). That is, this is the aspect of
that person tries to immediately exclude yourself (because it is an
area of ??”headache”). Not surprisingly, the girl from a young age
worried as she would in the future be saved from what she most hated!
(This is understandable, who wants to implement a program of its
duala?).</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">On the other hand, Dumas his program also will not go anywhere. And
while he lives with anyone - even for someone - then it will give
pleasure, arranging for a loved one small “touch holidays” …</div>
<div class="line">- So the only thing you need to worry about the girls Don - Quixote -
so it’s a marriage with dualom …</div>
<div class="line">… Noticed that when Dumas is the head of the family aspect “sensory
experiences” in the family becomes an integral value. Example - one of
our family talantleveyshih fashion designer Valentin Yudashkin
(Dumas). His wife - Don - Quixote - Beautiful woman fashion model in
the past very successfully runs the house. (At least his wife - dualu
like her cooking.) The house cult aesthetics. Daughter - fully
developed child; favorite activity - drawing …</div>
<div class="line">- Who is she sotsiotipy?</div>
<div class="line">- Also Dumas (ie, the ideal - a perfect psychological compatibility
with both parents).</div>
<div class="line">- So in all respects a happy and harmonious family …</div>
<div class="line">- And God forbid that has always been so! Another example: a family of
artists Alexander Kalyagina (“Dumas”) and Eugenia Glushenko (“Don”) -
also dual happy marriage, three children, a successful professional
career both spouses …</div>
<div class="line">- A possible option is whether a large age difference?</div>
<div class="line">- Possible. And here’s an example: husband - Dumas, older than his
wife of 25 years. (He - 48, she was - 23 dual marriage) …</div>
<div class="line">- And she looks happy?</div>
<div class="line">- More than he wears it on his hands, (in the literal sense of the
word), makes her breakfast in bed …</div>
<div class="line">- So my husband and running, and he is engaged in a kitchen?</div>
<div class="line">- And why not? And if the wife “and work, and a kitchen doing”? In
addition, to the family, we’re talking about cooking - it is part of
their overall “love game”, it is their “ritual”, the traditional rite.
Therefore, both spouses are involved here: the husband - prepares wife
- and tastes inspired by his presence. Romantic names invented dishes:
salad “Desire,” pudding “Tenderness” - or what - something like that
… Here’s a family idyll …</div>
<div class="line">- And another question: who in this dual pair takes the initiative
when dating? Who was the first reduces the distance?</div>
<div class="line">- It is believed that the first inclined to be proactive ethics -
sensing. (Combination of “ethical initiatives” - “partner selection”
and “sensory initiatives” - “capture” partner “). But in my opinion it
depends on how the person is aware of his program and how he wants to
implement it. Don - Quixote can easily reduce the distance because he
is interested in people and pretty. Also, if Don decides to start a
family as soon as possible, he does this in order to reliably “to
cover their rears” and be free to intellectual creativity - that is,
again, in the interests of their program.</div>
</div>
<p>Dumas sees its program to create a harmonious family with a loved one,
take care of it and raise his children. So no matter who the first one
to work - can come to Don Dumas and tell that - something interesting,
or Dumas can first go and treat than Don - lint, the main thing - it’s a
coincidence attitude and value for interaction. For irrational dyads are
primary conditions dualization. Then comes the “grinding” on rational
aspects - that is, shall be verified convergence of views, attitudes and
principles, as it already does all life.</p>
