<span id="ile-bukalov"></span><h2>ILE (Don Quixote)<a class="headerlink" href="#ile-don-quixote" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>People of this type are discerning of latent possibilities of people, things, objects, ideas, developments and discoveries. They are interested in everything new and unexpected, and generate a lot of ideas. However, it is easier for them to talk of ideas or hypotheses than to implement them into practical development and implementation. They realize this themselves, thus do not hesitate to ask others for help. As a rule, they have a very large circle of acquaintances.</p>
<p>The range of their curiosity is very broad. They tend to read a lot and on different topics. Due to their intuitive submergence, they are quite scattered - may forget things, not to notice a friend, or pass by their stop on public transport. His thoughts and ideas ILE tries to articulate logically, sometimes developing rather sophisticated and interesting theories, which he may use for minor everyday activities as well as for serious research. In this way, for example, Galileo Galilei discovered by logical methods the law of falling bodies, and what we call the principle of Galilean relativity; Karl Marx created the theory of economic relations; Albert Einstein - Theory of Relativity, and Sigmund Freud - his famous theory of psychoanalysis.</p>
<p>Typically, ILE looks calm and relaxed, but in extreme situations becomes mobilized, showing considerable willpower and determination. If he is being threatened, he can deliver a sharp rebuff, which is often surprising to people around him. If he’s playing on a team, by shouts and orders he can mobilize his teammates. Dislikes clarifying and sorting out relationships and conversations on this topic - this irritates him. At times, in the name of reason, tends to ignore the moral demands of society - as Sigmund Freud published his research on sexuality despite the opinion of the public, which has turned away from him.</p>

<p>People of this type are very perceptive of the world through their subtle sensations. Artistic productions, pictures, architecture, music, paintings, literature - bring up an aesthetic reaction in them. Smells, sounds, images and colors are remembered for a lifetime. A person of this type knows how to “situate” himself in space, how to feel at ease in the most unfavorable conditions, even if this person is a climber who is climbing a mountain or a traveler on a long trip, he seeks to “adapt to the terrain”, and no one better than him is able to find the “sweet spots”. He senses his own condition, as well as the state of people around him. He feels the emotions of other people around him, manipulates these emotions, may say consoling and supporting words, to remove irritability.</p>

<p>People belonging to this type are usually very emotionally perceive reality - live emotions that often seem to others too intense. “Hugo” sees very emotional state of other people, their mood and feelings. It appreciates the family - it comes first for him. He likes to go to visit and welcomes visitors. “The greatest luxury - Antoine de SentOkzyuperi wrote - it is the luxury of human communication.” In chatting with friends “Hugo” has spared no time. His emotional wildness ( “furious Hugo”) can show Xia and incendiary speech to the audience, and in the fiery verses, and in the all-consuming love.</p>
<p>It is “a strong, cheerful, open-minded person.” Rational and persistent: putting a goal, it seeks to achieve, in spite of any obstacles. Thus, H. Schliemann in childhood set about trying to find the city of Troy, sung by Homer. He grew up, became a merchant, learned many languages, and then organized the expedition-tion. And he found Troy because passionately believed in it. I must say that the humanities disciplines, such as linguistics, in “Hugo” exceptional ability. Engels knew about a dozen European languages. “Hugo”, being engaged in the study of something, is a card file with the words, terms, plans his actions. Among the “Hugo” a lot of revolutionary politics: Camille Desmoulins, George Washington, Sima Bolivar, Che Guevara. “Hugo” loves to create comfort and coziness, lead his home in the aesthetic appearance, likes to work with his hands, perfectly prepared and delicious. It seeks to be aesthetic in words, expressions, movements, dressed as a musketeer Aramis, from the novel by Alexandre Dumas. In dealing with people trying to look like a business man. In “Hugo” is very complicated relationship with time - often late, delayed due to the inability to calculate their actions in time.</p>

Appreciate the precise, though abstract and logical ideas and strive to create for himself a holistic, complete view of the world as a kind of logical system. Whatever happens, it should be explained, in their opinion, logically. Among the “Cartesian” many philosophers. Here we can recall the great German philosopher, Hegel, his grand system of philosophy. We may recall the Greek philosopher Plato who created his theory of the State in which he revealed his understanding of an ideal society. In this series, we can recall, and other authors of utopias - T. Mora, T. Campanella, also created their own theoretical system of society. “Descartes” considers it necessary to do right, no matter what.</p>
<p>General characteristic of people of this type - to go to the goal of consistently and systematically, despite the impediments. To this type belong and great humanists, scientists, fighters for social justice, Thomas Jefferson, NK Roerich, ID Kurchatov, PL Kapitsa. These include the academician AD Sakharov, who fought until his death for the triumph of the ideals of democracy and humanism, despite any persecution of the totalitarian system. “Descartes” often worried about human relationship problems, he tries to understand them “as, for example, the great German philosopher Immanuel Kant, with his categorical imperative, or NK Roerich (” The Living Ethics “). In a conversation with people,” Descartes’ shows politeness. He does not like to use strong-willed pressure on people and does not tolerate strong-willed pressure from others. All the time giving intellectual work, but quickly tired of diverse physical work.</p>

In this case,” the Great “knows how to arrange people to places and begin to act decisively, breaking and sweeping away all obstacles. It is practical, collected man. He loves to play sports, physical labor.</p>
<p>Witty ridicules people who do not like him. Able, if necessary, create groups for clandestine mafia type, batch, etc. Complete dedication, dedication can achieve success on the way to the goal of “the Great”. Since SP Korolev showed these organizational qualities in the project of space exploration. “Macedonian” always listens carefully to the interlocutor. If the team has a new man - carefully watching him, making of it their own opinions. He listens to the advice of others, how to behave in a particular case, but after analysis of variants act in its own way - something like the principle of “We immediately consulted and I have decided.” He does not like to talk about their feelings openly show them. Among the people of this type are a lot of generals and politicians: S. Razin, E. Pugachev, T. Ermak, Peter 1, Napoleon Bonaparte, Marshal Zhukov, etc.</p>

Sometimes dreams and fantasies lead him to think about how to live a good life in the natural merging with nature as well go back to that state. It wrote JJ Rousseau - a prominent French philosopher, but even earlier, in China, the philosopher Lao Tzu declared human dependence on nature, the need to be in harmony with it, follow the natural rhythms se - law of the Tao. We may recall the most Sergei Yesenin extols the native nature and experiencing in St. Petersburg nostal-ogy for “birch calico fields.” “Yesenin” feels the emotional state of others, very gentle and considerate in communication, more sentimental. Easy “Esenin” smile and the first cosmonaut - Yuri Gagarin. In the family, “Yesenin” if he wants to achieve anything, can use emotional pressure “playing the whole drama with tears, rage and fury. Thus, if the goal is reached, an emotional outburst may cease and be replaced by a calm smile. People of this type, especially women , distinguished elegance, aristocratic clothing, manners, speech and gait. Self initiative to physical labor did not show, but once they do it will say it is easy to begin to cook, wash dishes, etc. “Yesenin” does not like to show their active business skills, ie the “cool”, earning a living.</p>
