<p>The <a class="reference internal" href="alpha_quadra.html"><span class="doc">Alpha Quadra</span></a> is characterized by a general, prevailing
attitude to establish pleasant relationships without any problems, which
may appear to have a “superficial” character. Mutual demands are
satisfied through compromise. Grievances are quickly forgotten. They
value having a sense of humor and responsiveness to erotic stimuli.
Common interests that are shared in an atmosphere of light, positive
emotional experiences helps to strengthen their relationships. In sexual
relations, they value freedom and openness. Partners are attuned to seek
perfection and intensity in their sexual experiences. They are
characterized not so much by their responsiveness to verbal stimuli, but
to touches and caresses. They are invigorated by fun, entertainment, and
delicious food.</p>
<p><strong>Description by A. Boukalov</strong></p>
<p>The sexual program of <a class="reference internal" href="alpha_quadra.html"><span class="doc">Alpha Quadra</span></a> is characterized by
tender touches and caresses. In the dyad SEI-ILE, partners “love each
other by their skin”, as if dissolving in each other’s embraces. The
sensing types SEI and ESE enjoy being gently stroked on their skin.
However, the ESE is much more emotional and passionate in his love
manifestations, because he has to shake up and active his dual, the
LII. The SEI, as an irrational type, shows more creativity and
flexibility in comparison. Intuitive-logical types, LII and ILE,
especially women, initially show less activity. Mirror relations
between LII and ILE are characterized by a paucity of emotions and
feelings, since both are logical and intuitive types. Mirror relations
between ESE and SEI are accompanied by bright emotions and sensations,
but there is often an accumulation of mutual subconscious
dissatisfaction with each other. In general, mirror relations in
marriage slowly “neuroticize” both partners. The ESE suffers more from
this due to his rationality, while on irrational SEI this has a lesser
effect.</p>

</div>
<p>Types of <a class="reference internal" href="beta_quadra.html"><span class="doc">Beta quadra</span></a> are characterized by a desire to test
the strength of their feelings. Feelings of mistrust give rise to their
tendency for strong relationships with jealous and possessive
sentiments. When there is a lack of trust - deep, strong, and often
dramatic experiences contribute to frequent quarrels followed by
successive reconciliations. Such volatile emotional states are full of
contradictions. A balance is achieved through suppression and submission
of partners. Their sexuality is characterized by a mood of seriousness
and passion. Often, one partner will behave in the opposite way of what
the other expects, resulting in contrasting behaviors and sudden,
unexpected emotional effects. For types in this quadra, coercive and
defensive behavioral tendencies are sexually stimulating.</p>
<p><strong>Description by A. Boukalov</strong></p>
<p>In second <a class="reference internal" href="beta_quadra.html"><span class="doc">Beta quadrant</span></a> the nature of sexual program is
of a very different kind. Here, tender touches and strokes leave
partners indifferent. Instead they strive for an intense effect on
each other’s skin, which manifests in strong embraces, when partners
squeeze and press each other. Both sensing type, SLE and LSI, are very
jealous: one thought of their partner’s infidelity may poison their
life. It is not a mere accident that William Shakespeare, an EIE,
describes how Othello (LSI) squeezes Desdemona when he is trying to
kill her. Let us consider a real example: a married couple, students,
an LSI (husband) and an EIE (wife), live in communal housing. Since
the wife is a sociable extravert, her husband is often jealous of her
contacts with their neighbors. The scenes resemble those of
Shakespeare: “Whom have you been with?” the LSI husband asks and puts
his hands on his wife’s neck. She screams out, and he releases her out
of fright. As for the SLE, he/she can in the moments of intercourse
give accurate and decisive commands to the IEI. Mirror relations
between SLE and LSI are quite complicated: in order to adapt to the
partner, the SLE needs to constantly control himself, to keep himself
in check. This tires him out, but if he doesn’t do this, he
“neuroticizes” the LSI by his sensory leading function, which is
absent in the EIE. From EIE the LSI expects expressive dramatic
feelings and support for his/her sensory initiatives. Meanwhile, the
partners may adopt the most unbelievable positions. It is interesting
to note that when types from different quadra meet, they view each
other’s behavioral peculiarities as unusual, which includes sexual
behavior. Thus, a female ESI was quite amazed by attempts of a male
IEI to squeeze her  she had to “teach him anew”.</p>

</div>
<p>The <a class="reference internal" href="gamma_quadra.html"><span class="doc">Gamma quadra’s</span></a> awareness and understanding of financial
issues is dictated by an attitude towards mutual, material benefit
between partners. They find a special significance in acquiring gifts
and assistance in resolving business matters. This creates a favorable
atmosphere and is also one of their erotic stimuli. However, in a quadra
that is generally inclined towards stable relationships, problems of
mutual understanding, frequent doubts, contradictions, and instability
of emotions gives rise to crises and unexpected turns. The inherent
emotional endurance of this quadra, combined with their rationality and
practicality, helps them to cope with these issues. Between partners,
volatile sexual patterns are the norm - from complete spiritual and
physical mergers to estrangement. They are excited by light acts of
resistance in a variety of settings.</p>
<p><strong>Description by A. Boukalov</strong></p>
<p>The sexual program of the third, <a class="reference internal" href="gamma_quadra.html"><span class="doc">Gamma quadra</span></a> is very
dynamic and often characterized by acrobatic behaviors of the
partners. In dual dyad SEE-ILI, the initiative is almost always in the
hands of the SEE, who uses his sensory function to direct his ILI
partner. The ILI submits even when he is simply decisively taken by
the hand. One ILI said: “If I am taken by the hand and led, I would
follow at once. I wouldn’t resist it but submit to the partner’s
control.” When it comes to the dual dyad ESI-LIE, here frequent change
of positions, high intensity of feelings, and high number of
intercourses within short periods of time (for example, a couple of
days) with subsequent long periods of cool down, relaxation and
restoration of forces, are all characteristic. If the SEE cools down
after the intercourse very quickly, the ESI might need one-two hours
of strokes and caresses by his partner. Mirror relations between ESI
and SEE resemble the mirror relations between LSI and SLE: ESI is also
quite jealous. It is interesting in this regard to compare the
intimate relations of SEI and SEE. These are called “contrary”
relations, or relations of complete opposites. This may result in
partner quickly growing cold towards each other, especially the
introvert, as they completely extinguish each other in sensory and
emotional sense. In “contrary” couples IEI-IEE and ILI-ILE such
extinguishment effect is weaker and slower to take place, because
their sensing functions reside in unconscious perception of both
partners.</p>

</div>
<p>The spirit of <a class="reference internal" href="delta_quadra.html"><span class="doc">Delta quadra</span></a> is characterized by an
aggravated reaction to mental and physical discomfort. Therefore, a
desire for harmony in all aspects of life is of special importance to
them. They are stimulated by the combination of a beautiful and
comfortable environment, delicious food, sincerity, and trust. It is
necessary for them to care for the mental and physical comfort of their
partners, as well as having safety and security in their relationships.
For them, deep feelings imply a full understanding of, sensitivity to,
and consideration for their partner’s problems. They value mutual
assistance in all things. Without this kind of responsiveness,
harmonious sex can be problematic. The slightest faux pas or
misunderstanding in a relationship can have an oppressive effect on
their sex lives.</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><strong>Description by A. Boukalov</strong></div>
</div>
<p>Playful behavior, laughing, tender pinches of the partner, etc. are
descriptive of the sexual program of the fourth, <a class="reference internal" href="delta_quadra.html"><span class="doc">Delta quadra</span></a>. The LSE shows more energy, though less creativity,
in order to “wind up” his shy dual EII, and therefore he holds back
less compared to the SLI. The SLI reserves his energies instead but
shows more creativity with his dual the IEE; for both of them the
approach is alike a high form of art. Female IEEs are characterized by
wriggling, coquettish, cat-like movements. This dyad is strongly
affected by external stimuli: movies, writing, lyrics, pictures,
literature. A weak spot of IEE is pity or sympathy: a partner can be
successful by telling stories of his sufferings and misfortunes. In
this situation, the IEE becomes gentle and tender, and feels an urgent
need to provide some relief. Incidentally, another epithet for IEE is
“Don Juan”: he can successfully court a woman, but in the last moment
evade physical closeness. In this, IEE’s dual SLI and activator LSE
take the initiative into their own hands.</p>

diplomatically nudge him towards showing some initiative in physical
enjoyment, as a great source of health, happiness and pleasure.</p>
<p><strong>ILE-Ti</strong>: Somewhat distrustful of feelings and may be tactless. But if
