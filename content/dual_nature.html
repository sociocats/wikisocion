<h2>The Nature of Love<a class="headerlink" href="#the-nature-of-love" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>What is the cause of erotic love?</p>
<p>Is it a humanized sexual instinct?</p>
<p>This is thought very often. However, love fulfills not one, but two,
completely independent needs: the need to relieve sexual tension and the
need for psychological connection with another person. Both are
dependent on intelligence, culture, social conditions are interrelated,
but not the cause of each other. The most convincing hypothesis seems to
us, in which the phenomenon is explained by the nature of human love as
the pair being. This was reflected many philosophers.</p>
<p>“One person - not a man” - Feuerbach wrote, “only in a pair, he finds
harmonious whole.”</p>
<p>“The true essence of love is - read Hegel - to abandon the consciousness
of himself, to forget yourself in the other and I, however, the same
disappearance and oblivion for the first time to find yourself and enjoy
myself (Gegel. Op., XIII, 1940, p.108).</p>
<p>Similarly, says Erich Fromm:”Love can be themselves and to preserve its
integrity. Love is a paradox in which two beings become one and yet
remain two. “</p>
<p>To explain this is not very intuitive phenomena by the ancient Greeks
used the myth of the androgyne, which tells Aristophanes to Socrates in
Plato’s dialogue “The Feast”. The myth that once people have the double
body - all pairs of hands and feet, two faces. And just angry Zeus cut
them in half. Therefore, each person is now a half, always eager to
restoring its former glory.</p>
<p>It seems sound lines Yu Rurik:</p>
<p>“It’s a natural feeling of unity with another human being - feeling
absolutely fantastic. We know that in the normal state a person can not
feel the feelings of another person, to experience them, and only at the
height of a strong love is a strange psychological illusion, when the
various “I” as it were, disappear, merge with each other, and people
become psychological androgyne, .. this is almost a literal
“reincarnation” - as if part of your “soul” moved into the body of
another man, has merged with his nerves, and now you can feel his
emotions the same way as their … why it happens only love, only close
friends - is unclear, psychologists and physiologists have yet to solve
this puzzle.</p>
<p>“If erotic love is a consequence of the psychological structure of man,
it is possible to speak not only in the language of art, but the precise
language of science. The belief that men enter into marriage, not only
in order to have children and sex life, what a lonely life, like psychic
loneliness in a marriage - an abnormal phenomenon, forced to look at
marriage more seriously.</p>

<div class="section" id="the-problems-of-psychological-complementarity">
<h2>The Problems of Psychological Complementarity<a class="headerlink" href="#the-problems-of-psychological-complementarity" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>If the person seeking mental additions, which means that it complements,
not every physically pleasing a partner, but only with certain
individual mental qualities. These qualities and want to install. To
some extent the right to assert that the need to complement the opposite
qualities. But our research shows that not every contrast can be called
complement. There is opposition, giving the constant tension or conflict
settlement activity of one another activity. And there are complementary
opposites, leading to a balancing of the human psyche, to the activation
of his life. The answer lies in each typology used by psychiatrists from
PBGannushkina, E. Kretschmer, Jung, A. Kempinski, ending with AE Licko
and K. Leonhard. For each ! Just have compatible and incompatible types
of people. And anyone who knows at least one of these typologies can for
yourself to check it. In general - as with all discoveries - the answer
is so simple that it boggles the mind why so far no one before has
thought neither we nor abroad.</p>
<p>The most mature to understand the compatibility and incompatibility of
different types of people is a typology of CG Jung. This is facilitated
by the author’s approach to the human psyche as a target structure,
whereas all other typologies are descriptive in nature. We shall begin
it. As for other typologies, then for those wishing to give a
comparative table (Table 3), which shows how the same types of people
are called by other authors.</p>
<p>One may wonder why the authors mentioned above did not see the law of
complementarity of man by man. First of all, perhaps, because they -
psychiatrists, who, by the nature of their occupations, work with
individual patients, deepen the knowledge of the characteristics of
individual types of people and could not observe their interaction in
constant mikrokollektivah: at home, at work. In addition, a long time
conventional wisdom that completely mentally healthy people - the same
type, that certain typical features appear only at a certain deviation
from the norm. That all people are “average” and only in patients with a
deflected behavior can be seen the typical features of some of
accentuation or psychopathy. Although, for example, AE Licko says
explicitly that certain accentuation appear on the basis of a certain
type of personality. We may add from myself, that determines the type of
individual human tendency not only to different mental, but also to a
completely different somatic diseases.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-advantages-of-c-g-jung-s-typology">
<h2>The Advantages of C.G. Jung’s Typology<a class="headerlink" href="#the-advantages-of-c-g-jung-s-typology" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>On one of the advantages we have already spoken. This is - a structural
approach. Furthermore, the author classifies healthy, not sick people,
why not enjoy such nasty names, but others (like sm.tabl.3). For his
name not psychopathic, but the strongest part of the human psyche, the
author referred to mental functions. The main functions - is the ability
of a person with a special ability to understand certain aspects of the
world. We will call these functions are elements of information of human
metabolism.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the name of Jung we do not quite fit. Therefore, what he
called thinking we conventionally call the logic of what he called
emotions - ethics. Not assert that our names are perfect, and there will
not be able to find anything more suitable, but they are more precise
than Jung.</p>
<p>For example, when K. Jung contrasts the types of mental emotional, it
seems that the first “think” and second “live emotions.” In fact, they
all think, just think about something else: the first of the objective,
the second in a subjective world around them. Therefore, if we are
talking about the latter, “these people have dominated ethical
thinking,” this does not sound so absurd as if we were to say “these
people have dominated the emotional thinking.” People with “ethical”
thinking tendency to evaluate and judge the surroundings in terms of
ethical - unethical attitudes and actions. People with a “logical”
thinking primarily interested in logic, illogical attitudes and actions.</p>
<p>So on the one hand, we are left with the principle of CG Jung to
construct names based on the most developed part of the human psyche,
and, on the other hand, these names have changed a bit, so instead Jung:
thinking, emotion, sensing, intuition, there logic , Ethics, sensing and
intuition.</p>
<p>The second amendment, which we had to make - twin names. And Jung
himself claimed and we have seen in my practice that a person’s
character is defined by one, but two “functions”. For example, when
talking boolean, we do not know which logical: the one with the sensory,
or one with intuition. And they are very different. The one with the
sensory - a practical and active person. The second is more a strategist
than a tactician, is prone to theories, philosophizing, the construction
of what are called castles in the air. They differ in all the everyday,
in every detail. The first is always neat, knows what is beautiful, what
is not always collected. Second - scattered, and while trying, as it can
be clean and focused, but he is not always possible.</p>
<p>Jung’s terms “extroverted” - “introverted”, we have replaced the
now-popular extrovert - introvert, but believe that the more appropriate
term would be extrotim - introtim made by analogy with krechmerovskimi
schizotim terms - cyclotim, because after the work of Eysenck, according
to tests which extended the trend of every social person, call an
extrovert, and each closed - introvert, these terms are ambiguous.</p>

<h2>Sense of Humor and 16 Types of Information Metabolism (IM)<a class="headerlink" href="#sense-of-humor-and-16-types-of-information-metabolism-im" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Due to the fact that differences in personality type - is not nothing
but a difference in the exchange of information signals from the
environment, personality types will be called types of information
metabolism. In short - the types of IM.</p>
<p>And here the information metabolism?</p>
<p>It turns out that the human psyche the world around us differentiate
certain parts or aspects. And every type of person one of these aspects
differentiate gets very, very well aware of the information, and
information about other aspects of perceived undifferentiated, in
compressed form.</p>
<p>Therefore, different personality types, having been in the same
circumstances, remember, and tell completely different and in different
words. The story is accompanied by various facial expressions and
emphasize other aspects of the incident. The main reason why one man is
pleasant, like the other - unpleasant, tiring, and is exactly what he
slovooborotami expresses his thoughts, what facial expressions,
gestures, tone of these words is accompanied, when one person touches
another, it does not so much by his actions, but rather by how he
explains these acts, which brings out their motives. Therefore, one is
forgiven for one that another way - no.</p>
<p>It may be recalled that the term information metabolism we have taken a
classic Polish psychiatry A. Kempinski. Apparently, he first said that
the basis of psychological discomfort is a violation of his human
information metabolism. Now we know that this disorder is not nothing
but a shortfall in just the right signals-stimuli from people with
complementary mental overload and unnecessary, exhausting, irritating to
people with whom contact is difficult because of its type for them, they
thought their express an obscure and unacceptable way.</p>
<p>People with improper type of IM is often hurt by any comments or jokes
that do not give any information or reassurance, but just annoying.
Every joke comes to us as a joke only if it is as if by accident, gives
an answer to some pressing questions and calming. Each sense of humor is
limited, because everyone wants to rest in something else. And so often
when someone is offended by our joke, we just think that this man has no
sense of humor. The truth is that his sense of humor is simply different
from ours: he is inclined to joke in other words, and quite a different
story.</p>
<p>In total there are 16 types of information metabolism (IM). Some of them
are better than one taken from the environment signals, other - other.
That one is available, unavailable to others. Some scattered and
forgetful one, others another. As these types come from? Apparently, the
long road of development rights of the individual psyche is specialized,
acquiring at the same time some one-sidedness. Formed a kind of a pair
of competing mental properties: if one child develops rapidly, the
growth of another delay. Therefore, the psychic structure of each
individual, his character and asymmetric one-sided. People - a social
being, not only because the production is in the public, but also
because of a certain way for a one-sided development of mind he needed
mental addition, he gets in his social environment for communication and
cooperation with persons with other mental structures.</p>
<p>Several people are working together more purposefully, more decisively
and effectively when they have a psychological support to people with
other mental warehouse. This is one of the secrets of simple
co-operation.</p>
<p>In the communication between people and their understanding of important
issues are intelligence and culture, to which individuals belong. But
when we talk about mental addition and mental compatibility, most
importantly - the type IM. It is determined by the order of selection
and processing of information received by the psyche. This order defines
many mental qualities of man: propensity, abilities, interests, forms of
activity, purpose and motivation of behavior, relationships with others,
aesthetic and erotic tastes. Each other is desirable to conduct a loved
one. Every need is not at all “oh, love,” and forms a loving sympathy
for the individual, which are acceptable and convincing satisfy the
psyche.</p>

<div class="section" id="differences-of-interests-and-areas-of-competence">
<h2>Differences of Interests and Areas of Competence<a class="headerlink" href="#differences-of-interests-and-areas-of-competence" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In order to meet their own needs to the person about the whole idea of
??reality. In the service of society people co-operate. The mechanism of
this phenomenon on our current understanding, is quite simple: some
aspects of reality are reflected in the brain with varying degrees of
differentiation and awareness. Those aspects, which uses only the
individual himself, reflected relatively generalized, stored as images,
experience, and skills. Those whose information is transferred to the
community, are perceived differentially, with great precision, allowing
to interpret this information and pass it in words.</p>
<p>What are these aspects?</p>
<p>Adaptation of the organism to the environment - never-ending chain of
acts of physical activity. All that is happening around the person in
the objective world, too, is nothing but a chain of acts of physical
activity. We can say that everything that happens to us and around us -
the same chain of acts of physical activity. A chain of acts of physical
activity is not nothing but a four stroke internal combustion engine:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>the potential energy;</p></li>
<li><p>the conversion of potential into kinetic energy;</p></li>
<li><p>the kinetic energy;</p></li>
<li><p>the use of kinetic energy.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>This is the four aspects of perception of the world, which, because of
its tipnoy nature, a person perceives a different awareness, one better
understands the potential of another person’s abilities (1 cycle), the
other in his emotional life (2 cycle) third - how it works (4 cycle).
Each of these aspects and assign the symbol we call them the elements of
information metabolism extrovert person:</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">I - the potential energy;</div>
<div class="line">E - the transformation of potential into kinetic energy;</div>
<div class="line">F - kinetic energy;</div>
<div class="line">P - the use of kinetic energy.</div>
</div>
<p>With these elements a person receives information about:</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">I - the potential energy of the observed object and the subject’s physical and mental capabilities;</div>
<div class="line">E - excitement and excitability of the object, moods and emotions;</div>
<div class="line">F - mobilizovannosti, will and strength and beauty of the observed objects and subjects;</div>
<div class="line">P - the activity of object and subject, their ability to work.</div>
</div>
<p>However, the world around us consists not only of moving bodies, but
also the fields of their interaction. They can be called a psychological
fields. The components of these fields - the relationship between
objects and processes which are perceived by people as a certain
feeling. So there are four measurements of the outside world, which,
because of its tipnoy nature, man, too, takes a different awareness.
Each of them also assign a symbol, and we will call them the introverted
elements of information of human metabolism.</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">S - the relationship between the processes occurring in the same time - space;</div>

<div class="line">T - the relationship between processes, events and actions in time, the presence or absence of time, danger, or safety of the future;</div>

<p>A few words about the origin of graphic symbols.</p>
<p>Extraverted sensing we will denote by a circle F, a figure which gives
the impression most full contact with all of the outside world.
Intuition - a triangle I, which fits perfectly into a circle. Logic and
ethics - is the external form and internal content of the same process.
Therefore, if the logic outlined square P, as a symbol of the severity
of thought, to the inner side of the same phenomenon - the emotional
intensity you need to choose a symbol that fit into the square. So there
was not one corner of the square of E.</p>
<p>Homogeneous introverted elements assigned to the same characters, only -
other colors: S, T, L and R.</p>
<p>So, in the process of information metabolism man uses eight elements of
informational metabolism, each of which reflects one of the objective
aspects of the world. Now each of these elements will assign the code
name, which in the future and will be used:</p>

<p>All eight elements of IM are located in the psyche of each individual.
That is, Each of us has the same forms of perception and information
processing. But in complex situations that require intellectual effort,
people tend to trust only one pair of elements: one extroverted and
introverted one.</p>
<p>It was they who determine the type of IM, and give us the right to call
it a logical, ethical, etc.</p>
<p>We can say that two elements are seemingly more intelligent and more
aware than any other. So a person who wants to be and to seem sensible
as possible, make efforts as much as it will, in all its activities to
use only these two elements. For example, a person with logical thinking
avoids talking about his feelings.</p>
<p>Now we can get acquainted with the list of types of IM in those names
that we use in all his works (see Table 2).</p>
<p>It was interesting to find out what mental properties, and what types of
mental prevalent among the population (Lithuanian SSR). To do this,
surveyed 100 men and 100 women, the survey data are presented in Table 2
of the same. There is no doubt that such a small and completely random
sampling of people (200 people) can not represent the republic. But it
is enough to understand that there is no one type of IM, only common
among men or women only.</p>
<p>Hence the relativity of concepts such as femininity and masculinity:
each type of them to invest in these words a different meaning. Real
extrovert femininity sees introverted girl extroverted introvert in, the
identity of a Boolean IM - in ethical thinking, ethical personality type
IM - in logical thinking. There is no absolute femininity or masculinity
absolute. There are men and women with various mental institutions,
which not only seem, but are perfectly feminine or masculine ideal, when
properly complement our own psychic structure.</p>
<p>Therefore, further when talking about combinations of mental structures,
for the sake of avoiding unnecessary confusion, we will not consider
gender. We talk about individuals with sensory, intuitive, logical and
ethical type of infarction. In instances where for the sake of speaking
figuratively, “he,” the same way you can say “she.” In some specific
samples, however, the ratio of psychological types is a high polarity.
In one group of Vilnius Pedagogical Institute in 1978-79. was 28
students with leading ethical elements and only one of the leading
logical element of IM, introverted extrovert 20 personality types - 9.</p>

<h2>Awareness of Love<a class="headerlink" href="#awareness-of-love" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Love - is it a conscious or unconscious phenomenon?</p>
<p>When one loves the fact that on their own chosen among others because it
is different with some advantages, is more interesting, valuable or
accessible, subject to the consciousness of love. It is the love of your
choice. If the object does not provide hope, and it is possible to find
another site more suitable, from a fairly quiet refuse. But not all are
so fond of. So just like individuals with sensory-ethical type of
infarction. Who sensory elements, and ethics are not developed (all of
the logical intuitions) do not love because we have chosen. They choose
what they love. Love = not what they do, and what happens to them.</p>
<p>There are people whose feelings are conscious and unconscious desire
(all intuitive and ethical). And there are those who consciously desire,
and feelings are not subject to mind control (all sensory-logic).</p>
<p>All ethical (ethical element in the first or second place) is not versed
in both their own and the feelings and emotions of others. They were not
shy, it is easy to talk about them (this applies to all kinds of
feelings: love, fear, admiration), unless the object of love, friends,
because feelings and emotions - is something that ennobles man, makes it
more valuable. All the logical sense of replacing and silent, since any
sense of weakness believe the opposite reason. So it is because their
feelings a little conscious, they do not come under the control of
reason.</p>
<p>All sensor is well understood for itself and others’ physical needs.
Able to assess your physical abilities and use them. That they are
elegant, graceful movements openly attract the attention of a partner.
Intuitive , at best, believe in what they say. And just as long as they
say. Therefore, always afraid of becoming dependent on the speaker’s
compliments. How logical is not inclined to believe that he loved so
intuitive constantly in doubt about whether that is attractive,
handsome, fit. Touch is stylish to be noticed. Intuitive often more
elegant, but only in order to not stand out, be less noticeable. He
seems to hide behind its elegance. touch of his attraction easily
recognized not only for themselves. Attraction - an ordinary,
understandable phenomenon, part of his beautiful sound of nature.
Intuitive shy about his desire, no right to impose this attraction to
another.</p>
<p>Summarizing, we can say that some want to love others - to be loved
alone - much to others - to be desired. Some with full justification be
called the subjects of love, others - objects. So there are people who
take all the initiative entirely in their hands. There is susceptible to
partial initiative and those who leave it all the partner. Here begins
the selection of mentally supplementing partners. Because, when both are
equally enterprising and equally reactive for friendship easily break
off. Or tired of the competition in the initiative, or is produced
tensions over the feelings of distrust Double-sided partner.</p>
<p>The fact that one type of IM calls love, so feel loved and respected,
the other may seem a proof of lack of feeling. Therefore, if there are
grievances in friendship (which is often unwise to hide), appears to
have mental inconsistency, which need to think ahead. When partners are
fully compatible with each other, they can not hurt by a careless word
or gesture, because they see the motives of every action, word and
sentiment. This is the color red, which nature has provided man, that he
was able to choose a suitable partner for him. Man these signals often
do not want to see, hiding his true reaction to think that in the future
things will change. But can not change the fact that it follows from the
mental structure, which was formed in childhood. Contradictions only
worsen.</p>

<div class="section" id="personal-qualities-that-should-be-considered-in-selection-of-a-partner">
<h2>Personal Qualities That Should be Considered in Selection of a Partner<a class="headerlink" href="#personal-qualities-that-should-be-considered-in-selection-of-a-partner" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>As we have seen in Table 2, there are sixteen different types of people.
In its basic qualities, that is - properties that define the type of
person or type of IM, they are divided into eight opposite:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>8 rational - 8 irrational,</p></li>
<li><p>8 extroverts - 8 introverts,</p></li>
<li><p>8 logical - 8 ethical,</p></li>
<li><p>8 sensing - 8 intuitive.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The first of these qualities - schizothyme - cyclothyme - innate. Others
are purchased by children under five years under the influence of the
nearest educating people, most of all - the mother.</p>
<p>Despite all its imperfections, we use the terms have the great advantage
that we can determine the name, someone who complements. If an
extrovert, the other necessarily - an introvert. If one logical, the
other - ethical if some sensing, then the other - intuitive. So, in a
well-coordinated couple - a dyad in which people complement each other,
are the DW in the names of both, we necessarily find all titles, that is
- logic, ethics, sensory, intuitive, and in addition, extraversion and
introversion. An example of one of such dyads: Logical-sensory extravert
- Ethical-intuitive introvert (LSE-EII).</p>
<p>However, there is another rule: both duals are always schizothyme or
cyclothyme. But schizothyme of cyclothyme also distinguish by name. All
schizotim in the title in the first place have the logic or ethics, and
all cyclothyme - intuition or sensory. So, for example, this pair cannot
be called a dyad, although the terms are obvious: Logical-sensory
extravert - Intuitive-ethical introvert (LSE-IEI).</p>
<p>These two people are bound not to complement, and the ratio of the
conflict, which is not suitable for any joint activities.</p>
<p>In Table 3, all types of IM are paired in dyads. It is also shown how
the same Timy IM called by other writers, that is, for what they
psychopathy accentuation or they are hidden.</p>
<p>A study of married couples shows a desire for a full complement. There
is an excellent partner as we know, only one of the sixteen
psychological types. With random selection of pairs this would amount to
about 6.25% (100%: 16% = 6.25).</p>
<p>In fact, among randomly selected fifty marriage Seventeen (34%) were
found to be optimal. Apparently, as in the behavior of nature and human
behavior, there is less random than we have hitherto believed. After all
of the above focus on the question of the specific qualities, which are
paired opposite qualities of man, as they manifest in your life:
rational- irrational, extroversion - introversion, logic - ethics,
sensing - intuition.</p>
<div class="section" id="rationality-irrationality-shizotyme-cyclotyme">
<h3>Rationality - Irrationality (Shizotyme - Cyclotyme)<a class="headerlink" href="#rationality-irrationality-shizotyme-cyclotyme" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>What is an innate difference between people? According to our data, it
is determined by the location of the cerebral hemispheres. One
hemisphere person perceives and processes information obtained by
observing the static objects, objects at rest, the other - when
observing objects that are in the dynamics, that is - of moving objects.
Therefore, one hemisphere may be called static, more - dynamic. It is
easy to check each, covering one or the other eye. When a person is
driving or just through the car window watching the fleeing homes, it is
much more dynamic works hard eyes. When the machine stops working the
other - static. When something on a moving look at a static eye - begins
a little ripple in his eyes, and you can even feel a little dizzy. This
can be seen and when we watch TV.</p>
<p>Since the static and dynamic hemisphere in schizothymia and cyclothymia
are different, in cyclothymia the object in a static monitors left eye
(right hemisphere), the object in the dynamics - the right eye (left
hemisphere).</p>
<p>In schizothyme - contrary to the object in his right eye is watching
static (left hemisphere), the object in the dynamics - the left (right
hemisphere).</p>
<p>If the information on the dynamics takes the left hemisphere, the
individual’s own dynamics also controls the left. Therefore, a
consistent right-handed, according to our observations and surveys are
only cyclothymia. Rationals by nature left-handed, although about 50% of
them are on a completely ignorant.</p>
<p>Rationals of cyclothymia in some way can be distinguished by the
addition and especially the movements. Rationals, even if they are
gaining weight, is inherent in some gauntness. Cyclothymia and when they
are bad - the softness and roundness of lines. Especially, the softness
of facial lines. As for the movements, they have schizothymic commit.
Moreover, each type of IM are different. Of angular and jumpy as if
moving up. In schizothymic extrovert (dynamics) angular gait. In
schizothyme introvert (statics) angularity disappears, there are
elements of the slide, but they also kept a very straight, with dignity.
However, the “slip” of which we speak, it feels stiff, inflexible it. In
cyclothymia movements are soft, always more or less impulsive. As to the
element of impulsivity, it no longer have cyclothymia extroverts that
are static, than introverts, who are speakers. And the facial
expressions and movements.</p>
<p>Here is what about the gait schizothyme P. writes Gannushkin:”Usually
they attract the attention of stiffness and angular movements, lack of
smooth and gradual transitions between them, and, in some, in addition,
it is striking mannerisms and pretentiousness, among others - the desire
for style, and finally, the third - just the extreme monotony and
poverty of movements. There is a schizoid who had never been in military
service, but amazing with almost military bearing, this bearing them
comes to the fact that they seem wooden … Especially a lot of
originality in their gait: some go without bending his knees, while
others - like jumping, a third dragged his feet when walking, etc. “(”
Selected Works “, Moscow, 1964, 143)..</p>
<p>True, the author writes about here schizoid, that is - schizothyme
accented with a fixed or behavior, but according to our observations for
perfectly healthy people - it all fits them as well. And the fact that
they seem to be “wooden” or “dragging feet”, is determined solely by
their personality type. The most “wood”, in our opinion -
logical-sensory extra</p>
<p>The same can be said about emotions: emotions cyclothymia much more
impulsive and less controllable than emotions schizothyme.</p>
<p>Why cyclothymia seem impulsive, and CG Jung called even irrational?
Because of their movements, actions and emotions are always a
consequence of some feeling, some kind of mental state. The answer to
the emerging sense of comfort, discomfort, serenity or uncertainty.
Cyclothymia internally before swinging, and only then react to a
situation or emotion act. The emotions and actions of others they did
not immediately respond. More precisely - not react to their actions and
emotions, and by these actions caused feelings. Therefore, their
reaction would be as slow, smooth, very adapted to the situation, but no
pre-thought-out, “creative”. Many actions simply “out of habit,” to the
established guidelines. Schizothyme react to the emotion of emotion to
act an act not swayed at once. React very wisely, thoughtfully, on the
basis of past experience. Therefore seem to be more rigorous, decisive,
“rational”, their movements faster and more angular, sharper and
emotions cool. Feeling for schizothyme - a consequence of the act,
rather than its cause: after proper action or emotion feel better, is
good, after an incorrect action it worsens. Therefore, both the actions
and manifestations of emotions and to think carefully studied. If
schizothyme feel bad, they think, what was done wrong, dig into the past
to have experience in the future. When cyclothymia feel bad, they think
not about the past and the future: what should be done to change the
mood.</p>

<p>In cyclothymia actions are impulsive, are nothing but as soon as an
adaptation to the real situation and their own feelings. We can say that
cyclotron works when he needs to get out of some situation, some states,
but schizothyme - on the contrary, when you need to create some state,
some feel. For example, the cyclotron cooks to do away with the
unpleasant feeling of hunger, schizothyme- that as a result of their
activity to get a pleasant feeling of satiety (cyclotron eat because
tasty schizothyme - even when it is gourmet - to be fed). Interestingly,
the hunger for cyclothymia mood reflected a much more powerful than the
mood schizothyme: hungry schizothyme can safely wait longer than the
cyclotron.</p>
<p>But in dealing with the subjects and objects is reversed. As cyclotron
can not act until it was seized by any sense, so schizothyme can not
communicate with the person until he does not feel to it some sense,
until there was some kind of installation. Without such a facility or
mature feelings he can not buy even a simple household items. There is a
same “swinging.” Cyclothymia communication begin without the “swing”, ie
without plants, with direct contact, during which people and their
quality are carefully studied. Only after the installation there and
emotions that define their relationship. Therefore, although the contact
with people cyclotome ties quickly, they do not say anything about his
feelings towards them. As schizothyme easily, “rational” behavior and
changes its form of manifestation of emotions, if they are not
reasonable, so cyclotome “rational” changes people, with whom he
communicates, if they do not match their qualities to their needs. The
same applies to household items and other objects.</p>

<h3>Extroversion - Introversion<a class="headerlink" href="#extroversion-introversion" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Extroverts from introverts are not only their mental properties, but
also externally. In an extrovert is always active right hemisphere. This
can be seen on the face and eyes. More than half of the developed faces
extroverts, as a rule, the left half of the face and left eye, the
introvert - right side of face and right eye. When we talk to the
person, usually chained the attention of the active eye, that is, not so
much looking at all the person’s face as the active eye.</p>
<p>The active side of the face often appears and is narrower and longer,
active eye - a large and seemingly more meaningful. But in the diagnosis
of myocardial infarction in type eyes to the error is particularly easy
to produce eye-schizothyme extroverts, because when they look at a fixed
object such as a camera lens or other person - they are expanding their
passive static, that is - the right eye. In general, these external
differences should be viewed only as a trend - there is a very deceptive
person.Persons extroverts are more mobile, less constrained by them
shows that a person can command and demand. In particular introvert
quiet different forehead. Sometimes it seems that they follow the world
of the third eye. Interestingly, the warmest, coldest, and how,
individuals - in introverts. Warmest in the sensory-ethical introvert
and Intuitive-ethical introvert, cold - in the ethical-sensory introvert
and Ethical-intuitive introvert.</p>
<p>What we believe the main or one of the main mental qualities of
extrovert? Propensity to change the outer world in favor of the subject.
Tendency to worry about the subjects and objects, changing their
relationship, as opposed to introvert tendencies to change subjects and
objects in favor or in favor of relations between them. In an extrovert
relationships between people in relation to the people themselves -
Secondary: the relationship must be what people want. In the introvert,
on the contrary, no relationship should be adapted to people and people
to the relationship, if there were contradictions, must change people or
their behavior, not attitude.</p>
<p>We can say that for an extrovert constant in the outer world are the
subjects and objects. For the introvert this constant is the
relationship between subjects and objects, and the resulting sense of
these relationships. People - a social being. And as it is formed of two
parts: the active psychophysical I (a man - it is an object) and their
relationships with people and other objects (a man - it’s his attitude.)
Extraversion - introversion of consciousness to one of them give
priority to, and it becomes a cause of the second part. Extrovert give
priority to psychophysical “I” of man, an introvert - relations.
Extrovert sure that the “quality of an object” is always quality. That
is to say that the attitudes and feelings to the world around him are
determined by the value of his personal qualities, or its activity, and
because in many ways these qualities is trying to improve. Introvert, on
the contrary, I am sure that his personality will be judged based on
relationships with others, depending on what feelings in others it
causes. Introvert in his own eyes is worth as much as are his relations,
so that all their conscious powers he tries to improve these relations,
tries to be accommodating, avoiding quarrels. The sum of all
relationships, feelings can be called the psychological field, and say
that introvert primarily concerned about the quality of the
psychological field, as well as the psychological field of other people.</p>
<p>For the extrovert social relations - a consequence and a sign of social
value, quality facility. Ordinary course of his thoughts: each entity
can improve their relationships with others and to call to his positive
feelings of self-improvement method. If the subject in society is a
modest place, so it lacks some socially valued qualities.</p>
<p>For the introvert, the basis of the material world is the relationship.
Quality-of man as an object - is a consequence and a sign of social
quality, value and its relationship of those feelings, which he calls
other people. His train of thought: everyone can increase their value in
the eyes of society, improving their relationships with others. If the
subject is not noticed and is not valued - so, not enough has
established the right attitude.</p>
<p>In light of these considerations it becomes clear that a common
definition now that the man - this is, above all, his attitude is
progressive in the mouth of an extrovert, which in this case will not
forget that society - not only people but also relationships. At the
time, as in the mouth of an introvert, who are so inclined to exaggerate
the role of relationships and underestimated the object, this definition
becomes dangerous, inclines to undercount the qualities of human
personality. From this mistaken idea that there is no one is
irreplaceable, that every man is only a cog, that person needs to be
changed as soon as he breaks the harmony of the psychological field -
unable or unwilling to adapt. Opposite the bend, which can make and do
extroverts - the assertion that there is no essential relationship, any
relationship that does not fit the personality and individuality, can be
replaced. Person as the individual need and the confidence that he
enjoys the respect and the right to be oneself, and confidence in the
constancy of desirable relations with the environment, stability in
life.</p>
<p>For an extrovert object orientation in the external world are the
surrounding objects and subjects. Therefore, they have certain rights
concerning the inviolability: the other object has a right to be what he
wants. If it prevents me, I change the relationship with him, but not
the object itself.</p>
<p>This is because for an extrovert objects and subjects - the fulcrum of
consciousness. Arbitrarily modify these objects - is to lose a foothold.
In this crumbling world that threatens the collapse of consciousness.
This is the same that cut the branch on which you sit. Because of this,
all extroverts painfully react to different “re-typing” change the
subject against his will. Each extrovert and so sure that everyone wants
to self-improvement. And every extrovert feel it my duty to help in this
voluntary self-help everybody else. Object orientation in the external
world for an introvert is the relationship and feelings of others.
Therefore, on the one hand, they are very attentive to them, but on the
other - are sure that everything in this area tend to the same goal, and
therefore, as much as they can help other people to build those
relationships.</p>
<p>Everyone is different some concern extrovert feelings, a certain
activity, something that drives him to act in situations in which only
the introvert is watching. Observes, creating the impression of
immersion in himself. It is important to understand that the focus
introvert - is not an immersion, and the ratio of the outer world. That
is, the observation of relationships between subjects and objects, which
he - in contrast to the extrovert - will not and can not violate. If an
introvert in his “immersion” of something thinking, it is not about the
problems of his inner life and the problems of relationships with other
actors and objects. Impression of a “self-absorbed” - the result of the
fact that any relationship to the outside world as people perceive their
feelings.</p>
<p>For all these reasons, in cooperation with the extrovert introvert
extrovert dualu gives a sense of confidence as an object with certain
qualities. Introvert his dualu - a real knowledge of what kind of
feelings for him nourish others, and, if needed, and how these feelings
change.</p>
<p>As we have already spoken, extrovert, adjusting to the real subjects,
objects, and their different manifestations, or to what is in them or
with them going, produces acceptable for these subjects and objects of
the relationship. Thus extrovert - the creator of new relations and new
feelings about logical and illogical, unethical and ethical, aesthetic
and unaesthetic, timely and untimely . Thanks to the creativity of an
introvert, there are subjects that differ new properties and facilities,
new designs, new kinds of emotional and internal agitation,
qualitatively new methods of work . The creative element is the second
element of the IM, for example, for it is while for it is .</p>
<p>Qualitatively, the new design appears only in the mind introvert.
Therefore, the most advanced in terms of news ideas among the known
Soviet aircraft was Roberto Bartini - logical and intuitive introvert
(). But to be creators of a qualitatively new social relations can only
be extroverts, however, and had all the classics of Marxism. But the
creator of a new type of state (the object) is an introvert, for
example, Thomas More ().</p>
<p>When you need something to reproduce the existing models, that is to
reproduce what has already been invented, or where something was - just
the opposite. If the inventor of a brand new product is the introvert,
the organizer of its production to an existing instance - only an
extrovert. Here, the first IM element manifests itself.</p>
<p>The production company is a manufacturer of products and systems, staff
working in it people. Type of manager’s personality defines the
relationship of these two aspects of reality. Extrovert personality
types are the main aim to see the expansion and development of
production, increase output. Collective and its interests should be
subject to this goal. This plant is productive in the need for rapid
development of the industry in search of internal production reserves.
Introverted personality types are the main aim to see the improvement of
relations both within the team and between staff and management. With
this setting, plans surpassed only insofar as it is necessary for the
team. This plant is productive in the uniform of the industry, when
coming to the fore the problem of stabilizing the team, ensuring the
sustainability of each of its members. This setup helps to stabilize and
society. Just do not forget the fact that each type of MI manifests
itself with its own way: we here give only a general line of
extraversion-introversion.</p>
<p>Extrovert likes an active life. About him we may say that he, showing
initiative, always to some extent “climbs on stage.” But the climb is
not so much to see him much to see and assess yourself more “objects”.
He was happy to assess and raises others. Introvert does not present
himself or so more than others. Others he did not notice. Evaluates only
on how they activate it to their attention and improve the overall
psychological climate, do not interfere. And quite honestly says that
the leadership does not work on it. But if it is put forward - can not
give up, do not feel the right. And taking a position, it remains so for
many years, feels indispensable. Extrovert and can leave himself an
extrovert can be removed for any errors. Introvert in a planned economy
does not error, because the plan as the ratio is always in trouble,
never razminetsya. No relations violates anyone’s feelings are not
annoying, its passivity and indecision can always be explained by
objective factors. To anyone who is active it looks like in dealing with
self-promotion. After all, at heart, he also tends to be more active,
but take the initiative, while from him that in each case is not
required, it can not. Afraid to be out of place active. And this is
called “inappropriate activity” audacity or stupidity, already
determined by the type of MI person.</p>
<p>Extroverted works to become more valuable and necessary to society, to
be of higher quality object, if you can - irreplaceable (because he
constantly questions the good feelings of the people), and for the
opportunity to take the initiative, which is also nothing else than just
a way to induce positive feelings other.</p>
<p>Introvert acts only out of necessity, carrying out duties and
responsibilities. In order to not go to someone the way, do not spoil
their relationship with humans. And by all means - to stay on everyone’s
mind. Because if he would not mind him will not require the activity,
confined to his duties, he will be out of business. It is often said
that the introvert allegedly operates only in order to be left alone.
This visibility. He does not want it. And why can not refuse any
executive position, though, and sees that the work fails, there is a
fear that after his “left alone” will not notice, it will be useless.
This creates an unhealthy self-absorption and monopolistic tendencies by
all means, by hook or by crook, to stay “in power”. Even if it
undermines the health. Fear of becoming invisible stronger than common
sense.</p>
<p>Extroverts do not like debt and obligations, love - responsibility. For
everything that’s going around, they feel a responsibility, which
activates them, forcing them to act. Accept responsibility for the work
of people and for all that you want. Responsibility is understood as a
privilege. But the notion of duty, responsibility for them are
associated with violence. Introverts, on the contrary, do not like
responsibility, like responsibilities. I am pleased to do what is their
duty and responsibility that allows you to be active and struggling to
get away from what’s called responsibility. The word “responsibility” to
them like sentence, punishment.</p>
<p>Exactly the same extent as an introvert avoids excessive activity,
extrovert avoids unnecessary feelings show, that is, their attitudes to
different objects and subjects. Because it is afraid to be an extrovert
and immodest to interfere with other feelings, introvert - its activity.
This they consider bad taste faux pas.</p>
<p>For psychological comfort to surround yourself with extrovert-oriented
relationships introverted, that is, people who can be with other
people’s feelings. Introvert feels the same need to be surrounded by
knowing how to notice and evaluate the people themselves and their
extroverted activity.</p>
<p>The company pays attention to the extrovert of others, trying to rouse
them, happy when people like this. If no one is paying attention, bored.
Introvert, on the contrary, draws attention to itself. He was bored, if
no one on notice.</p>
<p>By seclusion more often introverted tendencies. But this is not a good
life, but only in cases where they feel unwanted and unnecessary when
they are no one pays attention to them as desired. In total, we has 8
types of introverts. Undoubtedly, each of them to the attention to some
other aspect of the manifestation of their personality. One must attend
to his work, the other - his emotions, ability or will. In a calm and
happy only when others notice and say exactly that he needs.</p>
<p>Extroverts also need such attention. Only to the other - to his senses.
He needs a belief in voluntarism of his feelings. In fact, he cares
about other people that he loves them, correctly assesses that he is not
selfish, etc.</p>
<p>Briefly the difference between all extroverts and introverts can all be
defined in this way. Extroverts in relation to the world are
constructive, active and have a strong need to achieve goals.
Introverts, even when they are very active, probably get away and
failures. If an extrovert constantly unhappy that did not even something
that could be done, the introvert feel bad if you did something that was
later proved to be unnecessary. He is afraid of being an upstart in the
eyes of their own a</p>
<p>A typical example of a student’s life. After successfully passed
examinations are extroverts are almost always a little unhappy that did
not have time for something to read. Most introverts with the same
displeasure think about what they read, and the exam was not required.</p>
<p>With criticism for slowness, laziness introvert can stir up. Any
incautious remark that he overdid it showed extra activity for a long
time consuming desire of every activity. When an extrovert has been
criticized for a lack of activity, he becomes aggressive, angry, feels
misunderstood. Criticism for being too activity is perceived more as a
compliment.</p>
<p>Extrovert - the initiator, inspirer and organizer. Introvert covers the
rear position - finish up other things, if even at the beginning and
showed no enthusiasm. He is more shy and quiet, at least believe in the
significance and importance of what he is doing more self-critical. At
the same time, more self-centered.</p>

<h3>Logic - Ethics<a class="headerlink" href="#logic-ethics" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Logical types of IM are different from ethics in their attitude to the
objective world and to other people.</p>
<p>The strength seen in the ethical treatment of people, the power of logic
- in relation to the objective world. Ethics are not sure what they can
do something objectively valuable, logical, do not know what they
represent in the eyes of other people, what rights they have.</p>
<p>Logic is trying to do everything himself. Their necessity to others
proves its own affairs, look at the deed myself, evaluate, and deserts.
Ethical feels his tenderness to others, is able to establish a
relationship with them, to manipulate their feelings or emotions, no
doubt about their rights to them. And always not confident in his own
powers and abilities that are long, painful and passively contemplating
when left alone.</p>
<p>Usually the logical types are perceived as more independent. But this is
only apparent, because in dealing with people of such different ethical
autonomy. Logical independence is manifested in the solution of the
problems and challenges of the objective world, independent of ethics -
in dealing with human relations and adjustment of their emotional life.
All logical effort to be positive, strong, good people, based on a
desire to please the ethical, to earn recognition. Logic often surprised
lack of independence of ethics when it is necessary to solve the problem
objective, ethical - just as the former do not know how to use people
who do not understand their influence on them.</p>
<p>A very important difference from the ethical logic is that logic usually
proves his innocence, and ethical - to persuade, it is easy to ask.
Logical nor persuade, or do not know how to ask, but on the other
persuasion often be easier. Logical promises can be trusted more than
the promises of ethics. Because the first by all means try to keep his
word, and if something can not say in advance, “not to deceive people.”
Ethics is not so important not to deceive people, as not to spoil
relations with him, so he often promises to not be able to run, and
something from it as from a “good man” others expect. He does not feel
like a liar, and a careful diplomat.</p>
<p>Evaluating the actions of others, uses more logical criteria: logical -
illogical, right - wrong, it is wise - foolish, rational - irrational.
The good news is that reasonable, rational can not be bad. Ethics: good
- bad, you need to - not to people or individual, humanely - inhumane,
honest - honest.</p>
<p>Ethics can care about people, about themselves and their loved ones, to
make them pleasant. But really honestly cares only about those who are
considered to “own”. Knows how to ask for them and, thus, to shift this
care and to strangers. So close they are valued and loved, forgive all
the errors. Logical at best, when he touch, can get what he supposed to
“as of right.” For ethical, there are no rights of one person among
other people, but what is really possible to “knock out” to get what you
can win, “sell on” any other human persuasion, requests, and emotions.
Best pusher - the ethical, of course, when he touch.</p>
<p>Ethical manipulate feelings and emotions of other people, so true and
not true for them have a relative sense. Often the truth is that other
people makes a pleasant, captivating them, and it elevates, it is also
makes a pleasant one. Be nice and loved - something that everyone wants
a virtuoso ethic. He knows how to create a good impression can account
for their deeds, and, moreover, to write reports - all praise, above
all, himself. Excellent feel in any company, among any people, can
easily become the emotional center of the company. Logical records in
inclined to talk about yet unfulfilled, of their own and others’
mistakes and shortcomings, disadvantages, because it tries to understand
the real situation, to see and show the real situation or perspective.</p>
<p>It should be noted that all logical ethics - the normative, they
strictly fulfill installed by someone other ethical standards and no
creativity in this currently not allowed. In the performance standards
and strive for perfection never sure what it achieved. Therefore, in
these endeavors are often disappointed. The ethics of ethics more or
less creative, they are not so much with the regulations as to their
specific circumstances. Is it ethical that improves the situation of
ethics makes it more charming, more essential, more powerful among
others.</p>
<p>The same can be said about the logic. The logic of ethics - the
normative. They strictly follow all logical standards, it is very
important that a scientific or at least accepted, because neither the
new logic of relations, or new methods of action, they do not open and
do not invent. In their actions and logical reasoning are very careful
and never sure of their perfection. For the same reason their logical
horizon of interest is wide, well-read they are more logical, well talk
about various scientific truths. Logic is usually distinguished
erudition in literature, which makes it possible to know the code of
ethics.</p>
<p>Ethical subtlety different feelings and emotions, although they are not
sensitive logic, absolutely not smarter as logical ethics. The essential
difference between them is that the ethical see and understand not only
their own, but also the feelings and emotions of others. In a relatively
unspecific actions, random words, facial expressions, ethical sees the
complex world of the senses of another person is better than seeing
itself logical, for which his own feelings - a little understood puzzle,
and we need to found someone who will solve it. Ethical behavior and all
types of other people’s feelings as measured by their own. Love - the
sphere of ethical thinking. His job and his talent. The main talent of
logic - the logic to evaluate others. Once they correctly assess the
ethical and logical mind and explain himself. They can assess the
activity of another in the same manner as ethics - goodness of man, the
depth of his feelings. Ethics itself can not estimate the amount of
labor, tends to drown in any business, including, in the household, is
never sure whether the moral right to rest or not. Therefore, the mutual
friendship of individuals with a logical and ethical way of thinking
(though not in every combination) both enriches and increases their
self-satisfaction. Ethical next logical doubts the logic of their
actions, the logic - that all his actions are the actions of a good man.
This is a continuation of one person to another.</p>
<p>According to our research, logical type is more common among men,
ethical - of women. But try to be more ethical such as the need, as it
is. So often emphasized courageous in a good sense of the word, there
are men with ethical thinking. The most feminine women, too, with
ethical thinking. Logical type is allocated a lack of any demonstration
elements. Therefore, men often seem to be “no”, and women, unless they
are introverted, relatively “masculine.” Logical thinking prevents run
for a rapidly changing fashion and do a lot of non-rational, practical
meaning without details (short haircuts, manicures, shoes uncomfortable
heels) because it gives the ability to appreciate their efforts and
energy costs.</p>
<p>As already mentioned, people with logical thinking can not talk about
their feelings, avoid it. The feeling makes them act in favor of the
loved object, but does not talk about it. If your relationship with your
loved ones are not quite tender, make mistakes, it is only because that
is not familiar with other behaviors. Such a man is often easier to ask
“Do you go out for me” than to say “I love you.” Feelings of the
individual with logical thinking gentle, fragile, easy to scare. In
order for them to become stronger, it takes time and active sense of the
second. In the same manner and behave in a girl with a logical type of
infarction.</p>
<p>Feelings of logical type are more stable because it takes longer for a
decision, while a sense of logical reasoning are tested. More time is
needed for the cancellation of the decision. Therefore logical that
dared to associate with someone their own destiny, that his decision is
inclined to keep more stable.</p>
<p>Ethical love consciously, loves because he wants to love. Love - the
conscious creation of pleasant emotions to themselves and others. If the
other most important thing is love them, that - whether they like: “You
do not love, but I love …” This expansion is most successful, as is
directed at people who are supposed to advance, must surrender. If the
object of attention does not give up on it very seriously say that he
was unworthy of love and because - let blames himself. Who did not
respond to feelings - ungrateful, unreasonable, or thinks he needs more
attention than was given. This means that he wants too much, wants more
than deserved. The life of these people are often difficult because the
objects of love there is too much, do not know when to stop, that love
is like, and this supports the other person does not. That for some
reason tiring strange feeling of anxiety that needs to change partners,
and that none of them are not what they would have made the object of
constant love and, finally, would give peace of mind.</p>
<p>For a person with an ethical type of IM love - one of the most important
issues in the world. But he needed a partner with the logical type of
IM, which did not show his feelings, but to them, these feelings - is
stable. His composure and draw logical logic. If a girl with ethical
thinking for some time been friends with a very smart in her view, a
guy, all his other friends, it will compare with it. And until he finds
one that will seem more intelligent, will feel hapless and unhappy. The
same can be said about the individual with logical thinking.</p>
<p>Ethics is not afraid of any type of feelings. Like love and hate. He
loves what is good, but with no less force hates the evil that causes
unpleasant emotions. And do not hide it. Therefore, if disappointed in
love, can become dangerous. He wants to love. Even when his feelings are
irrelevant.</p>
<p>It can be a sense of exchange for something else: a positive feeling to
another object or a negative to the same, but do not give up the most
sense. When he is convinced that the favorite is “bad,” “unworthy,”
“change”, ie Although nothing new, in fact, did not happen, but some
drop overflowed the cup of his patience, positive feeling turns into a
negative, love to hate. If your partner thinks that the services and
concessions ethical endless, that self-denial - of his character - is
wrong and is digging himself a deeper hole. Not able to measure their
deeds, ethical, in the end, you still see clearly. That is, there comes
a time when he can no longer conceal from themselves the “ingratitude”
is not evaluating its service partner, and is furious.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="sensing-intuition">
<h3>Sensing - Intuition<a class="headerlink" href="#sensing-intuition" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Sensing types of IM live in the fullest sense of the word senses: able
to perceive the nature, art, enjoy all the visible, audible, palpable.
Very accurately feel your physical “self” and its needs, have clearly
expressed the rhythm of life.</p>
<p>Touch lives as if only this afternoon. All that will happen tomorrow,
for a little surprise. Thanks to the undeveloped abstract thinking, he
has no sense of anticipation and hopes only for their strength and will.
He too is active or (extrovert) and complicates the lives of himself, or
too passive (introverted), is afraid of errors, not sure what once
seemed to do - to do. Afraid to overdo it - it would make him ridiculous
in his own eyes, as well as in the eyes of all the other introverts.</p>
<p>Feelings of intuitive types they do not have enough brightness, they are
constantly distracted. Even his physical “I” is perceived by them
indefinitely. Often confident in their materiality, it is sufficient
only for as long as they look in the mirror.</p>
<p>Touch lives a different life, otherwise eat, or breathe, or feeling for
nature, beauty, that is a different interpretation of the fullness of
life that intuition is available only next to his loving and respectful
touch. At the same time, the touch thanks to his friendship with an
intuitive, can more calmly contemplate going to trust the future to
avoid surprises. Intuitive happy to adapt to the required rhythm touch
him, if he goes to other parameters (intelligence, interests, culture),
at the same time giving a vision for the future and enrich the sense of
the relativity of each activity and an endless number of new features.</p>
<p>Touch, in the fullest sense of the word, attentive to all his physical
needs, evaluate them as an integral part of the physical “I”. Therefore,
the drive - an inalienable right to self-actualization and a means to
influence other people. Intuitive to drive, as well as all the specific
environment and his “I” is not fully perceived and not very reliable
phenomenon. They are always skeptical and unsure - reality or just a
product of fantasy fiction. So do not take the initiative in their
hands, waiting for it from others. Touch looks for an object of desire
and tries to achieve its physical implementation. Intuitive feel the
need to become the object, as it allows you to be yourself - gaining the
right to their own needs and desires. Attracted a partner - proof of its
materiality, that is, the moment of mental addition. Means of
reification, the materialization of the “I”. The attraction for them to
need, and it is desirable, however, is dangerous. They are inevitably
drawn into the rhythm of life as a partner in a whirlpool from which
themselves can not escape. Hence - the fear to get into obedience and
prudence.</p>
<p>Consequently, the only sensory rather than intuitive object are trying
to attract attention. In their hands, and the initiative faded out of
feeling, if it turns out that the second satisfies not all mental health
needs is not a real addition to the individual. In other sensory needs
consistency and a kind of dependence, obedience. So can only be
intuitive, which supports the initiative of touch, but in their own
hands to take it can not. Intuitive quickly realizes that is desired,
but after that shows no activity. Own sexual activity is taboo for him.
Not because of shyness and a good upbringing, but this creates
additional difficulties, but because of the specifics of their sexual
activity. If you show an activity greater than the activity of the
partner feel very bad, positive attitude to the former partner turns
into a negative. Any closer to the intuitive difficult, so he is more
reserved and, despite his free-thinking, which often differs generally
not inclined to enjoy sexual freedom.</p>
<p>An interesting feature of jealousy in the relationship and intuitive
touch. Intuitive knows - nothing will change from random acts of
partner. Jealous of touch, which is judged by his own experience. On a
small dose of jealousy intuitive effect is positive, giving it value in
his own eyes. Recalls that he needed, and we wish irreplaceable. This is
the most convincing proof of its value.</p>
<p>Every successful intuitive cares about others than about himself. Touch
understands your financial interests and knows how to defend them.
Intuitive expects that remain of the other or care about it as long as
others.</p>
<p>Sensor intuitive normative, he adheres strictly to the established
aesthetic norms, such as fashion, is not ready to any revelations.
However, if it is not no Sensorik complements their efforts on these
tires is lost and can reach a total of neglect and disorder in everyday
life. The aesthetics usually knows a lot, but in his aesthetic taste is
not sure. Not sure about the aesthetics of the body, clothing, and
movements. So intuitive often look awkward, certainly, if there is no
direction from supplementing. In the presence of “director” reach
perfection and surpass a happy sensor systems.</p>
<p>These same standards apply to well-being. Sensorik trust your instincts
and do not doubt, when he was healthy when ill: he - “feels.” This
physician must submit his specific, real feelings, but he was not
unfounded diagnoses of a doctor. If a doctor “found nothing”, he gets
her and goes to another. Intuitive sense of their own seem to be less
objective than the diagnosis of a doctor. Diagnosis - is the “norm”, and
it behaves according to the diagnosis, but is not adequately being.</p>
<p>In sensory regulatory “intuition”, so it is extremely cautious in the
use of his time, as well as the use of potential energy, potential
sites, subjects and events. Sure, there’s no creativity does not work.
Therefore, the touch - tactics, and intuitive - a strategist.</p>
<p>They differ in appearance and: eyes, gait. Intuitive eyes - the eyes
that look and not see. Touch your eyes, on the contrary, the eye is very
good seeing and noticing all the people. The gait of each of intuitive
less confident, as it would be a bit floating in the air and everyone is
ready to give way. The gait is different sensory clarity,
self-confidence, obstinacy.</p>
<p>Another interesting aspect. The most narrow face appear in people with
introverted intuition. The most extensive - people with introverted
sensing. Take, for example, intuitive extroverts and sensing extroverts.
Both are statics, so no innate differences, if we take the average of
one representative of another type, should not be. However, those
intuitive extroverts tend to appear elongated. This is mainly due to
wrinkles around the mouth and forehead. But the face of sensory
extroverts - round. This is mainly due to the development of these
strong-willed people cheekbones. Compressed jaws are particularly
striking in the sensory-ethical extravert.</p>
<p>In the eyes can be judged not only on how the sensor or intuitive
person, but also about how extroverted or introverted its sensing and
intuition. This is determined by open eyes: the most wide eyes in people
with extroverted intuition, I, the narrowest, most screwed up, people
with introverted intuition T. This is most noticeable when the person in
the meditative state. Distributed sensor systems in the middle, and
people with sensory extroverted they are wider and less sharp than that
of people with sensory introverted. This is because the first attempt to
cover all the observed space, and second, only a few objects. On the
disclosure or half-closed eyes, all other things being equal, that is,
when a similar addition of individuals from all types of IM is possible
to form such a series (from the broadest to the most narrowed):</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Intuitively logical and intuitive-ethical introvert</p></li>
<li><p>Logical-intuitive and Ethical-intuitive extravert</p></li>
<li><p>Sensory-logical and sensory-ethical introvert</p></li>
<li><p>Logical-sensory and sensory-ethical extravert</p></li>
<li><p>Logical-sensory and sensory-ethical introvert</p></li>
<li><p>Sensory-logical and sensory-ethical extravert</p></li>
<li><p>Logical-intuitive and Ethical-intuitive introvert</p></li>
<li><p>Intuitively logical and intuitive ethical extravert</p></li>
</ol>
<p>We said earlier that ethicals types can not assess the value of their
labor. Intuitive same can not assess its quality and therefore also are
drowned in endless affairs. They just do not believe that the work is
done well enough, and therefore can not finish it.</p>

<h3>Statics - Dynamics<a class="headerlink" href="#statics-dynamics" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The world around us is formed from the moments of the statics and
dynamics. Some elements of IM reflects static - it is and , and in
others - the dynamics - it’s and . Those types of IM, one of the first
two elements, which is an element of statics, called static, the other -
dynamic.</p>
<p>Any incident is really well can tell you only the speakers. According to
their story always easy to recover the sequence of the process in time.
Statics do not know how, they always get an analysis of the situation or
story about the people involved in the accident and subjects. Static
analytical thinking, inductive, thinking the speakers - is a synthetic,
deductive.</p>
<p>This difference is clearly seen in the figures. In the dynamics of each
line - a pulsating motion in statics - complete rest, rigidity. For
example, Roerich father - static, Roerich son - dynamic.</p>
<p>Statics always know what they need, easily come up with a life purpose
and goals for daily activities. Complexity in them - with coming up with
methods to achieve these goals. In speakers, on the contrary - always a
choice of creative methods, but the goal is desirable that someone
suggested from the outside.</p>

<h3>Other Qualities<a class="headerlink" href="#other-qualities" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>There are other, less obvious opposite qualities that distinguish
partners in the dyad. Some people usually say in the question-and others
- in the affirmative intonation. First like to get an explanation,
others - to explain, tell, declare different truth. A long dialogue two
people with a question mark tire each other with their problems with
declarative - its useless instincts.</p>
<p>These types speak in questioning tone: LII, ILE, EIE, IEI, ESI, SEE,
LSE, SLI.</p>
<p>This, as we see, all the same social extroverts rings and all other
social introverts ring. (More on this in the “Theory of intertype
relations.”) In their eyes and faces quite clearly see a question mark.
Especially in the eyes of the SLI and LSE.</p>

<h2>What Psychological Complementrity Provides for a Person<a class="headerlink" href="#what-psychological-complementrity-provides-for-a-person" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>No man can be both extrovert and introvert, intuitive touch screen and a
logical and ethical. His mind is like a magnet, formed of two individual
poles. Only the poles of a magnet are always together. A man -
asymmetrical, his second pole is a different person.</p>
<p>The relationship between the two types of IM, when the second has the
necessary complement of quality, called for additions, the process of
additions - dualization.</p>
<p>The life of man in society is complicated by its duality and,
especially, his shestnadtsatitipnostyu in which to get his second pole
is not always possible. And without additions - nedualizirovanny people
- restless, hungry spiritual being that has no representation of what
the essence of his hunger, and who is to blame. Such a person feels that
he is “not understand”, but who’s to blame - he, “difficult childhood”,
the spouse or a society - not sure. In this state, it is difficult to
live in peace with the world, pile up all sorts of conflicts,
contradictions, and wanton aggression. The man reaches out to others for
answers, and often even more confused in themselves and their
relationships. It is hard to find, if not themselves favorable
conditions and a suitable microenvironment.</p>
<p>For human well-being and functioning as it is extremely important social
individual psychological structure of a spouse. No single harmonious
personality. Harmonic existential man, when he has not only loving but
mentally and complementary partner-dual. Marriage - not only entitled to
a sexual partner, but also on mental addition and extension of his
personality in the other and dualization of his psyche.</p>
<p>Therefore, one of the moments of preparation of youth to the family -
learning to recognize differences in psychological structures for the
selection of a suitable partner or fully adjust to not entirely
suitable. With the understanding that unacceptable behavior is not
determined by his partner’s ill will, but an objective psychological
structure, it is possible to at least partially conscious adaptation. In
addition, in the knowledge that it is not completely satisfying partner
and myself could not be fully satisfied, it is easier to find a
compromise.</p>
<p>A deeper analysis of the relationship of young people showed that
psychic structure not only determines the behavior in marriage, and
premarital sex behavior in friendship. The way a person is fighting for
the initiative, or avoids it, as it attracts, flirting, nor is the
manner in which stresses its restraint, independence is a complex
defense mechanism. This mechanism, in some measure, shuts the attention
of the psychologically unsuitable partners and attract the right. Each
has a different psychic structure-making system and show sympathy. In
other words - the mind itself can take care of themselves, unless
circumstances do not interfere with her. Unfortunately, this mechanism
is adapted, apparently, to act in an environment where young people are
familiar from childhood, that is, from the time when there was no danger
to confuse mental and sexual needs. Or when the error occurred and
corrected, without paying a marriage. Today, to the innate need to add a
little apprehension of psychological knowledge.Only the ratio of
additions and gives a complete sexual compatibility. But such marriages,
as we have seen enough. You can not say that marriages are made too
early. Rather - people learn too late, when there is no verification of
the nature of the conditions. And because of too narrow circle of
acquaintances, friends, and because of ignorance of the laws of
psychological compatibility. It is too late to choose suitable person by
nature or not, when people learn that just time to get married, have
only to do and learn. Sexual attraction in this age does not sleep, it
is always ready and easily taken for “real love”. But everyone expects
from a spouse is not something else, but the full complement of mental
and psychic balance.</p>
<p>How do people with mental complementary perceive each other? Like most
“humane” person. The most humane, gentle, accessible, and responsive. So
it is. In addition, a partner who always knows what to do and when you
answer, that advise, what a joke to dispel tension. Who understands
everything, always able to support, protect, never hurt, and that,
perhaps more importantly - he had never offended . When activated, each
Douala and feels stronger and more right. Nedualizirovanny person
constantly, in the manifestation of any activity as it is beyond the
limits of their capabilities and loses his balance. And what is called
the rest, is not so much to recuperate, but rather to restore mental
balance.</p>
<p>Many people do not know, do not feel that such a dualization of the
psyche and therefore do not seek it. During the period of premarital
friendship quite often a tendency to look no dualization with calm
spiritual comfort, and a “great sacrifice”. And suffering. There is
confidence that the feeling of love must be accompanied by spiritual
suffering. But this is only true for those cases where the lovers do not
complement each other.</p>
<p>Dualization improves self-esteem of man. Thanks to her, always
understood and its own utility to others and their own place in society.
A second continuously provides reliable information about it. Lost all
sense of inferiority and fear to feel like an upstart. To complement is
not seen as an unattainable Prince, next to themselves the kings.</p>
<p>Everyone is “sour” mood, as reflected in some grouchiness. It is
noteworthy that grouchiness duala never perceived as a broadside. It is
often grumbling - that form of communication, which differs very much
spontaneity and Double-sided understanding of where everyone knows at a
glance when the shortest time partner passed the most extensive
information about what is happening in the objective world, and - most
importantly - his confusion, uncertainty related to this happening.
Grouchiness - just turned to the partner poluosoznannaya please explain
something unintelligible. At this nagging nobody except Douala react
properly to give a satisfactory answer or explanation, and sometimes
silent, can not.</p>
<p>The source of irritation and conflict between people at work and in
family life is the manifestation of a clash in the initiative or the
inability to catch one another and support the initiative. In duals,
such conflicts are not possible. They work smoothly, this coherence by
activating and balancing each other. One picks up another initiative to
ensure that the right moment to return it in the first hand. Alternate
activity leaves no attention bypassed sections in an executable work,
increases the efficiency of labor, reducing the need for its execution
time, leaves no room for frustration.</p>
<p>What is being done by one, the other is perceived as a manifestation of
extremely valuable and rare abilities, skills. The constant surprise and
the right (not all, as necessary ) and egged praise inflame emotion.
Douala is not only unwilling but also unable to destructively interfere
with each other. They have no ability to do so, because there are no
words that can hurt each other. After all, one person offends another is
not so much by his actions, but rather by what words he explains these
actions, what motives to the fore, which mimics his explanation
accompanies. How to converge with the appearance of common interests,
and diverge in their absence is very simple, without complications. If
this couple, they would like to knit one thing in common.</p>
<p>Such a partner does not need conscious concessions. Everything goes as
if by itself. The relationship between them can be serious or humorous
business. Never - the vicious and aggressive.</p>
<p>The phenomenon can be explained by the duality of man and in this way.
The basis of dualization are mechanisms of information and energy
metabolism (IM and EM) duals. This sequence has identity. But while
those units IM and EM, which are pronounced in a co-player, the other
located in the most undeployed state. Therefore, for any joint activity
of these people set off each other well. Manifest this identity and
complementarity in any joint activity. Especially clearly noticeable
when starting a new business day, when words and gestures one would
serve as the ignition key to the other. And also in sexual games. On
this issue, psychologists, N. and A. Abozau in the article “Diagnosis of
marital difficulties,” they write, “… for the psychophysiological
interaction are not only purely sexual characteristics of partners (a
type of sexual constitution, sexual potency, etc.), but … reactivity,
psychodynamic behavioral characteristics … as a result of this
dissatisfaction of some non-sexual contact is a spouse in a narrow
sense, but a form of erotic games, the manifestation of sexual interest
… “(Journal of Psychology, 1982,  2,. 147).</p>
<p>So - we may add - who once got into the arms of co-player, is not
inclined to change them for anything else. With respect to complement
and not sexually holodnyhlyudey frigid women. The couple are sexually
active for a long time.</p>
<p>Sexual behavior of different types of IM is very different. Therefore,
the real sexual compatibility can only talk between complementary. We
illustrate this with an example of two opposing dyads - dyad
sensory-ethical extravert and introvert sensory-ethical. These two
opposite sensing dictate to its partners and the opposite of “touch”
behavior. In the dyad sensory-ethical introvert, “love” the skin, its
entire surface. There are no sudden movements, as partners would melt
into each other’s arms. In the dyad sensory-ethical extravert, on the
contrary, avoid contact with skin and merging bodies. There are many
sudden movements, postures and almost gymnastic exercises.
Interestingly, the sensory extroverts do not bear the touch of another
person, even, for example, contact your doctor. Another person’s hand
and that only serves its own initiative.</p>
<p>And in marriage duals may be temporary misunderstanding. This sometimes
happens to people who do not feel its dual tendencies due to the fact
that growing up in families where relationships have not seen mental
additions, do not feel as free people behave, how easy it is natural
when someone has complements. Douala should be able to “program”.
Programmed when the act impulsively, “according to the dictates of the
soul.” In cases where at least one has the immediacy of this, the second
very quickly learns how to “take the progra</p>
<p>In cohesive families in which husband and wife have complementary
personality types, children, as a rule (unless the child was born
cyclothymia not schizothyme, while shizotimov - cyclotron), acquire the
same types of IM, as well as their parents. Daughters often grow up with
types identical to the parent, the children - his father. Daughters of
the type of supplemented his father and brothers, sons - the types of
mother and sisters, provided that children are raised by their own
parents. This is the best, most harmonious family. To educate these
children easily, on such parents say that they have an innate talent of
educators.</p>
<p>The relationship of identity, as well as for additions are needed to
form a stable psyche of children: no one can become a better teacher
than an identical, and the best tutor than an individual with a
complementary type of infarction. Therefore, in families where parents
are complementary to each other, created optimum conditions for the
education and socialization of children. Man, one of whose parents had a
complementary type of mentality, feel a sense of value and significance
for people. He is confident that it - like a child, and throughout their
lives - will understand and love - in the future family and work
community. He has a more easy-tempered and nervous system more balanced,
better socialized. Others, who with their parents ‘unlucky’, always
feel, in some measure, lost, guilty, or unnecessary, they lack the
mental immune system, appears brighter aggressiveness (the extroverts)
or conformity (the introverts). They often get into situations of
conflict, are buried in the neuroses and any chronic disease.</p>
<p>Dualization is a prerequisite for successful not only mental, but
physical and successful functioning of the body. People with mental
dualizirovannoy much less ill, more likely recover.</p>
<p>Dualized psyche affects on human health, because every element of them
not only reflects certain aspects of objective reality, but also
controls the body. For each element of the IM are certain meridians and
manages system. Systems that are behind the most advanced, leading
elements of the IM, the least vulnerable to the disease. First of all
get sick of those who are leading a co-player.</p>
<p>According to our hypotheses, the elements are aligned with the meridians
of IM as follows:</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Ne Posterior median meridian;</div>
<div class="line">Fe The meridians of the stomach and pancreas;</div>
<div class="line">Se The meridians of the bladder and kidneys;</div>
<div class="line">Te The meridians of the gallbladder and liver;</div>
<div class="line">Ni The front middle meridian;</div>
<div class="line">Fi The meridian of the heart and small intestine;</div>
<div class="line">Si Pericardium meridian and three parts of the body;</div>
<div class="line">Ti The meridians of the lungs and colon.</div>
</div>
<p>Our observations confirm this hypothesis. For example, the logical
extraverts and indeed often suffer from heart, and ethical extroverts -
the kidneys, and intuitive extravert - stomach, pancreas, liver.</p>

<h3>Logical Extroverts and Ethical Introverts (LSE - EII; LIE - ESI)<a class="headerlink" href="#logical-extroverts-and-ethical-introverts-lse-eii-lie-esi" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<div class="section" id="the-first-dyad-logical-sensory-extravert-lse-te-si-and-ethical-intuitive-introvert-eii-fi-ne">
<span id="lse-eii-aushra"></span><h4><strong>The first dyad: logical-sensory extravert (LSE : Te-Si) and ethical-intuitive introvert (EII : Fi-Ne)</strong><a class="headerlink" href="#the-first-dyad-logical-sensory-extravert-lse-te-si-and-ethical-intuitive-introvert-eii-fi-ne" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The main quality that the logical-sensing extrovert possesses and highly
values is logic - the ability to act reasonably and logically. This is
the only quality of which he fully approves and in which he trusts
completely. It is of no importance whether he is clever and intelligent
or not; if people around him question his logic, this does not greatly
bother him. Due to well developed sensing aspect, he is extremely
perceptive of the aesthetics of his surroundings and may be a hedonist.
Interestingly enough, the LSE pays most attention not to the
intelligence of someone, which, in his view, is a quality that is
constant and unchanging and not dependent on the person, but to person’s
ability to act rationally and his or her external appearance. It is not
as important to him how clever his partner is, as his partner’s elegance
and physical form, which is seen as being dependent only on this
person’s own will. Excessive weight he takes to be a kind of untidiness
and even a challenge to the public taste, and generally one of the most
inappropriate phenomena. He accurately and with precision distinguishes
beautiful things from ugly ones; but beautiful things that are also
inconvenient and useless for his rational mind do not exist. He dresses
elegantly and with taste, but doesn’t dress up. He wears his clothes for
a long time, and this clothes always surprises by its freshness and
careful wear, as if the time factor doesn’t exist for it. He won’t wear
uncomfortable shoes either, as he lives for himself and not to be a
decoration for his surrounding world. But everyone else around him
should dress very nicely - for his aesthetic satisfaction.</p>
<p>His attraction to persons of the opposite sex is quite conscious; he is
not afraid of it. It is those who don’t experience it who are truly poor
- they have a need to hide, but not him. There is greater difficulty
with feelings. He feels the need for love, wants to love and be loved,
but doesn’t know how to make a poem out of love. Tries to attract a
woman by being considerate and gentle, offering his help and services,
and with gifts, but not by beautiful words about his feelings. Suffers
from this; to him it seems so difficult and pointless. Thus in feelings
he is passive, and therefore this is his vulnerable side. Cannot fall in
love quickly; afraid of being deceived or of mistaking the desired for
the real. If love is contrary to logic, he will cast it aside. This is
one of the types that is conventionally considered to be “manly”.</p>
<p>People with developed sensing have underdeveloped intuition, therefore
they try to avoid anything that is accidental and unexpected and want
total clarity and certainty. They cannot love a person in whom they have
some doubts, whom they do not trust, with whom problems arise. They
cannot love those who are completely independent and therefore do not
need their help and care, as well as those who don’t show and
participate in a certain kind of compliant caretaking themselves. In the
area of feelings they don’t feel like they can take risks: they may
desire the one who doesn’t desire them, but cannot love a person who
doesn’t love them back. They need a partner with deep introverted
feelings and emotions that are balanced and almost imperceptible on the
surface, that is, a person whose inner world constitutes the ability to
measure the feelings of others with their own feelings. For the logical
extravert it is extremely important to receive a very tactful and
positive emotional evaluation of all his actions, concerns, and efforts.
Life is bright, easy, and clear when he doesn’t spoil the mood of his
partner, when he delights his partner.</p>
<p>The princess of his dreams does not show a lot of initiative herself,
but waits to be noticed. (However, the initiative in making contact with
a new person lies in her hands, as an ethical type). When others pay
attention to her, she holds herself with discretion and tact, and
doesn’t show any negative attitudes even when joking. Such jokes are not
understood here; they are perceived as negative emotional appraisals of
one’s personality and subsequent distancing. Affectation does not entice
nor attract anyone here.</p>
<p>In this dyad, for one’s partner there is a sense of responsibility.
Protecting and guarding partner’s interests against real and imagined
enemies is often done more aggressively than protecting one’s own
interests. Care is also show by means of providing directions and
instructions, by means of correction and regulation of partner’s
activities. Anything that a partner struggles with and cannot do is
taken over with pleasure and done for him. But only if he was truly
struggling, not not from lack of will and wish. That is, both people in
this pair try to overcome any difficulties that interfere with the
productive actions of their partner. If a partner falls under someone’s
influence, and listens to the advice of others, this is not liked here.</p>
<p>Since the logical-sensing extravert (LSE) has a developed and even picky
taste (in behavior that is dictated by the second, and not the first
element, a person is always more picky), he has a tendency to dictate to
his partner his own perception of beauty. He is always sure that he
knows what is beautiful and what is not, when something is matching and
appropriate and when it is not. And it is not as important to him
whether other people like it or not, or that the public thinks it
fashionable or not. It is much harder for LSE to live with a person who
has his own sensory preferences, than with a person for whom he needs to
solve the sensory and aesthetic problems, someone who lends himself to
LSE’s will and listens to his instructions.</p>
<p>The most suitable are feelings of ethical-intuitive introvert (EII).
This is a carrier of quiet, internal, imperceptible to outsiders sea of
feelings. The world of his feelings is so refined and rich, so
self-confident and self-sustained, that verbal evidence of love is not
even required by him. He sees without a word who loves whom how much,
who is needed by whom, or not needed. A valuable trait of this type - is
the ability to adapt to the emotions of another person, to empathize
with another person, to remove their emotional stress and strain, to
calm them down. These are people who are always in love with someone,
always admiring and bowing down before someone in their souls, even
though they often make an impression of being cold, self-contained, and
even insensitive. Their love, as love of any intuitive type, is platonic
and incorporeal.</p>
<p>As it is important to the logical-sensing extrovert to be loved by
someone, otherwise he doesn’t know how to love, so it is important to
the ethical-intuitive introvert to be desired. He does not date to
desire someone, with his own inclinations he is not satisfied, tries to
drown it out, to not be influenced by it. Courage does not come soon,
along with faith in his loved one and the confidence that his desire
does not seem ridiculous and won’t humiliate him in the eyes of another.</p>
<p>Ethical-intuitive introvert seeks pleasurable emotions. These are
provided by intelligence, logic, activity and operativeness, ability to
protect, and demanding nature of his partner. No other evidence of love
and talk of love is need. It is needed that the partner would evoked
these pleasant emotions and admiration by his behavior - that he would
not be late for dates, that he would carry out promises, that he would
be polite and caring. This state of awating, that is never deceived, and
during which one can dream any number of dreams, is one of the greatest
pleasures of this type of IM.</p>
<p>Such man or woman wants to live according to the tastes and desires of
another, not so much because he or she does not have their own, but
because he/she wants full harmony is a relationship, complete fusion of
the will. Therefore, on the one hand, there is an inclination to comply,
but on the other hand there is a no less ardent desire that the tastes
of both would be the same. The ethical-intuitive introvert wants to know
what the other person likes and wants to adapt it. But trouble will come
to any person whose nature is not of logical-sensing extrovert, and who
due to this won’t be able to adapt to the ethical-intuitive introvert,
i.e. won’t be able to fulfill her basic requirements: to always and
everywhere have own opinion. Trouble with come to a man, who may be very
clever, but who expresses his views in form of contemplation and
thoughts, and not in the form of short categorical statements. Next to
him the Ethical-intuitive introvert is constantly dissatisfied and
unhappy.</p>
<p>We can say that ethical-intuitive introvert does not have enough
character, that he or she shows impermissible tolerance, being too
yielding, that every educated person should have his own well-formed
preferences and tastes. But when in one marriage there are two people
each with their own “tastes”, for example, logical-sensory extravert
(LSE) and ethical-sensory introvert (ESI), often what is obtained is not
two distinct tastes, but collisions and fights between two independent
from each other egos.</p>

<span id="lie-esi-aushra"></span><h4><strong>The second dyad: logical intuitive extravert (LIE : Te-Ni) and ethical-sensory introvert (ESI : Fi-Se)</strong><a class="headerlink" href="#the-second-dyad-logical-intuitive-extravert-lie-te-ni-and-ethical-sensory-introvert-esi-fi-se" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The strong side of logical-intuitive extrovert (LIE) is also logic. Due
to well developed abstracted thinking, he is inattentive to the
appearance of his partner and pays little attention to it. Often it’s
even that a partner with too good physical qualities hinders him. He
needs not a person who is most beautiful to him, but rather someone for
whom he - is the most physically attractive. Due to his inattention to
his environment, he don’t always understand how other people see him,
frequently feels unconfident in his own appearance, or upset over his
imagined unattractiveness. For intuitive types the recognition of their
physical “I” is extremely important - and therefore they need partners
with a well developed aesthetic sense, taste which can be trusted, they
need to feel: he liked me in spite of the fact that he has developed
sense of taste, is picky and even pretentious. He liked me, despite the
fact that towards other people he is very critical, that the majority of
them he considers unattractive. I am attractive to him not because he is
indifferent to how I am, but because I am as I am.</p>
<p>Ethical feelings and emotions of logical-intuitive extrovert are
underdeveloped, as is for every logical type. He can continuously love
only that person whose well realized feelings would be enough for two,
and whose conscious desire is would also last for two. In domestic life
this type is absent-minded, fully trusts the tastes of his partner, and
allows him to command him.</p>
<p>Ethical-sensory introvert (ESI) is best suited for his partner. This is
a creator of deep ethical feelings and love. But since this type has
well developed sensing, it is a very independent type of person, who
monopolizes in his hands both sides of the erotic. This type doesn’t
show his emotions, thus often seems to be a cold person, and due to his
penetrating sharp gaze with which he keenly evaluates and judges his
surroundings, even spiteful. In conversation he doesn’t look directly at
the other person, as if to not incinerate him with his mistrustful
piercing gaze.</p>
<p>The second element is more creative than the first one. Therefore, any
of its manifestations are more pleasant to the individual and seem to be
more valuable. Thus, towards the aesthetics ESI is very picky,
categorical and often even unpleasant. All people love order. Some need
it more than others, but it’s easier for all to have some order.
However, individuals who have sensing as their second element notice any
deviations from the accepted order in exaggeratedly acute manner.
Perhaps this is why their look feels discomforting, prickly, and
spiteful to some. Domestic order (especially in absence of
psychologically complimentary partner) could be made into an idol, not
taking into consideration the expenditures of time nor energy and
efforts. For them, their own sense of taste and view point on art,
clothing, interior design, that is, to anything that gives or may give a
pleasant sensation, is very important. Only those people who don’t have
their own “aesthetic sensing program” feel at ease around them. Only an
intuitive type can easily adapt and be happy when another person
provides him with a “sensing program” that not only facilitates,
simplifies, but also enriches his life.</p>
<p>Ethical-sensory introvert (ESI) does not think about the future, lives
by the present day tasks, and dislikes waiting for anything. “What I can
do today, I won’t postpone until tomorrow.” And today he can do whatever
has come into his mind. This type is uncompromising and stubborn, which
is why he makes such a good match for the logical-intuitive extrovert
(LIE), who lives not by the present day, but by what was and what will
be in future, and does not pay sufficient attention to the present
moment. The logical-intuitive extrovert also loves not by word, but by
deed, however, in contrast to the logical-sensory extravert (LSE) he is
not inclined to come up with these “actions” and “projects” himself,
rather in all everyday concrete activities he would happily submit to
the will of his partner. At any time he can drop one task and start on
another, if only his partner wishes it.</p>
<p>A student of type ethical-sensory introvert (ESI) wrote the following
about a guy of her dreams: “He is fashionable, always neat and timmed,
and of slender built. Very polite and soft in interaction, attentive to
me and to other people. Not envious, not a liar. Not selfish. On all
questions has his own opinion. Together with me, he goes to the theater,
to movies, to art exhibitions and concerts. He likes long walks,
traveling, camping trips. He talks a lot, tells of everything that comes
to his mind. And at home - he is my helper and assistant.” In this
description we can see the image of the logical-intuitive extravert. He,
like no other, likes to talk and discuss all that he has seen, read, and
heard. Only he could obediently carry out all other wishes of this girl.</p>

<p>Emotions of ethical extroverts are strong, colorful, persuasive,
delivered with great expression, and not seldom quite commanding. These
people are not timid about their emotions and do not hide them. The
depth and variety of their feelings - is the most valuable of what they
find in themselves, and the basis on which they evaluate other people.
They try to perfect emotional ways of expression, hence their especially
strong attraction to poetry and music.</p>
<p>They readily talk about not only about their feelings towards their
loved ones, but also about any other feelings: fear, hatred, etc. Of
that which has surprised, delighted, or infuriated them, made them lose
their patience. Meanwhile their emotions are controlled, directed, and
managed consciously. Mood is what they do and create themselves, not
what happens to them without their conscious will. Emotions are often
the main substance of life, its essence, and at the same time - an
ornament, not a complication, as is the case for people of logical
thinking. Ethical extroverts are usually very pleasant
conversationalists and good listeners - able to understand, admire,
approve, sympathize, to get into another’s shoes. Thereby, they
encourage others to be frank, helping to sort out their emotions.</p>
<p>With their ability to approve and inspire, they transfer their
enthusiasm to others, raise their mood and spirits, inspire them to act.
Emotions of these people are so strongly controlled by their conscience,
they are so confident in their validity, that any feelings evoked by the
object of their love do not make them confused or hesitant. The only
person is strange and incomprehensible is the one who never admires
anyone, who never delights or makes others feel something.</p>
<p>They often think that only confident people don’t hide their emotions
i.e. people with high self-esteem. Needless to say, this is connected to
how much you respect yourself. However, people who respect their
emotions aren’t always confident in demonstrating other sides of their
personality: intellect, will, ability. Here, the only important thing is
a sense of legitimacy of one’s emotions. And the fact that not very
confident in him/herself ethical extrovert is not shy of their emotion.</p>
<p>Well-mannered ethical extravert sees the need to hide some of his or her
negative emotions: disgust, outrage, etc. But why hide admiration, why
not try to increase the self-satisfaction of another person?</p>
<p>The ethical introvert, whom we mentioned earlier, tries to understand
another person and receive pleasant emotions. The ethical extrovert
doesn’t look for emotions for him/herself, but rather tries to give
emotions to others. Bringing joy to another person he feels happy
himself. The meaning of life - is to provide positive emotions for
people around them. To promote their activities, to give them courage,
to inspire, and, if necessary, to stop them and send them into a
different direction. (That is why these two ethical types - extrovert
and introvert - doesn’t understand one another, and suspect each other
of selfishness and hypocrisy).</p>
<p>The ethical-sensory extrovert (ESE) has developed sensing, therefore he
notices not only personal but also physical qualities of people. He
needs not only personal, but also physical data. This type is interested
only the mental and intellectual traits, but also the partner’s ability
to interest by his appearance, he physical bearing, elegance. This type
has a developed aesthetic sense. Cannot stand clutter and untidiness.
Doesn’t adapt to someone else’s sense of taste. The interesting for him
logical introvert seems closed off, mysterious, difficult to understand
for others, and, therefore, exclusively attractive. The bright emotions
of ethical extrovert, his ability to enjoy all that is good and
beautiful, improve the vitality and raise the spirits of logical
introvert. Logical introvert is not insensitive, but he’s not always
certain if his emotions are appropriate. Ethical-sensory extrovert is
just that person who skillfully expresses that which has accumulated in
logical-intuitive introvert’s soul. This is why the logical-intuitive
introvert appreciates him.</p>
<p>The logical-intuitive introvert (LII) is a particularly suitable partner
for the ethical-sensory extrovert (ESE), as he is sufficiently pliable,
readily adapts to his partner, approves of his sense of taste, responds
to his erotic initiatives. Logical-intuitive introvert can admit his
feelings and his attraction only when in the eyes of his partner - his
loved person - clearly, unequivocally show not only his feelings but
also his desire.</p>
<p>The LII is not selfish. If he doesn’t always consider the interests of
others, then his own - even more so. The LII, more than others, wants to
feel as a good person. But it’s exactly this feeling that’s insufficient
in him. Therefore, he needs a partner who protects his interests and who
would chide him for his lack of selfishness and lack of taking care of
himself. Someone who doesn’t encourage him to work, who doesn’t require
activity, who doesn’t care about his interests and doesn’t make him take
care of them - doesn’t love him. Not taking care of him, like all
intuitive types, is impossible. Without care, intuitive types can make
too great demands of themselves and exhaust themselves physically.
Protection of his interests and his good name and criticism for
exhausting activity, the logical-intuitive introvert receives as a
recognition of the value of their person and a proof of love. This is
something without which he finds it difficult to live. Everything else
is of lesser importance.</p>
<p>The strongest side of LII - is logical thinking. Encouraging him to
social engagement extraverted intuition is his second, creative
function, which nonetheless also requires recognition. Therefore, he
needs the approval of his partner to feel satisfied from his own
activities. Not receiving such approval the LII feels lost. Thus, his
functioning as a person depends on the intelligence partner, his
sensitivity and ability to approve. Occasionally, he even tends to check
the emotions of his partner by little understood antics. If his partner
reacts in the way that is acceptable to him, then there’s contact,
everything is alright. Disapproval of his wrong actions is necessary as
the compass that orients him in public opinions. In addition, for as
long as a partner is interested in his activities or work, he is
interested in his personality. Thus one needs to make sure that he still
disapproves of any misdeeds. If he does, this means he notices, cares,
pays attention.</p>
<p>Relationship with a sexual partner are complex. He does not change the
object of desire not his desires on his own will. It can be said that he
loves the one, who is certain that he loves himself, and who knows how
to be confident that he is loved.</p>
<p>Extraverted emotions - are the basis of union between two people, in
which the more emotionally active ethical extravert instills into the
more passive and less bold in his undertakings logical introvert
confidence of his own activities, supports him and activates him. This
influence that one person has on another is reminiscent of a miracle,
the extent of which will depend on the intellectual level of both.</p>

<span id="eie-lsi-aushra"></span><h4><strong>The second dyad: ethical-intuitive extravert (EIE : Fe-Ni) and logical-sensory introvert (LSI : Ti-Se)</strong><a class="headerlink" href="#the-second-dyad-ethical-intuitive-extravert-eie-fe-ni-and-logical-sensory-introvert-lsi-ti-se" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Emotions of the ethical-intuitive extrovert (EIE) are also well
expressed and clearly visible to all, but they seem somehow abstracted.
He may talk and share his feelings with others, but his feelings remain
platonic: he doesn’t dare to desire even a very loved person. Of some
importance here may be poor sex education, such education only further
complicates their lives. They are sympathetic towards anyone who has
showed them good feelings, but it takes a long time and persistent
attention from a partner for that feeling to turn into a desire. Their
attraction, as with all intuitive types, has a kind of “in absentia”
nature: the object of love is quite consciously desired only in its
absence. When the beloved person is before their eyes, attraction seems
to be something unreal and fantastic. If a partner does not sufficiently
understand them due to a psychological incompatibility, even if married
they may avoid sexual intimacy. They express their feelings for their
partner not by concrete help and care, but by dramatic stories and
warnings of the dangers that might befall them.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the ethical-intuitive extravert (EIE) is characterized by
a certain innate haughty or arrogant manner of holding him/herself. From
aside it seems that for some reason this person is “putting on airs”,
pretending or posing as something. This “arrogance” is very attractive
to the practical in his activities, but closed off in his relations with
other people logical-sensory introvert (LSI). It gives him a peculiar
sense of confidence and security. He is grateful for this firework of
emotions that refresh and enliven his own feelings, that have been
driven underground. And for the fact that ethical-intuitive extravert
readily adapts him/herself to the practical and aesthetic program of the
partner.</p>
<p>The logical-sensory introvert is an aesthete. He has a very acute
perception of beauty, a wish to see it around himself, to evaluate and
to enjoy it. He’s not such a gourmand as the logical-sensory extravert
(LSE). It’s not as important to him what he eats and drinks.
Nevertheless, he wishes to impress the world by his own elegance and
especially by elegance of his partner (more accurately - by beautiful
objects).</p>
<p>The logical-sensory introvert does not hide his attraction, does not
feel shy about it, and frequently gives the impression that he
deliberately demonstrates it. His piercing, grasping gaze does not leave
unnoticed and unevaluated any person of the opposite sex, which to some
may feel unpleasant. However, this grasping gaze does not disconcert the
ethical-intuitive extravert as much as it convinced him that he is truly
appreciated and wanted. The logical-sensory introvert offers his hand on
basis of his attraction of which he is fully aware and cognizant and
vaguely felt to him feelings. He judges the feelings of other people
based on external manifestations of emotions. Therefore, he relatively
easily can become mistaken and confuse his desire to be loved for true
feelings of his partner. He knows of this himself, therefore he is
mistrustful. In this sense, the ethical-intuitive extravert with his
highlighted arrogance - is exactly what the logical-sensing introvert
needs: it is unlikely that such a person will become close with anyone
before understanding that the feelings that connect them are real.</p>
<p>The logical-intuitive introvert in love is even more dependent on his
partner than the logical-sensory introvert. Not only does he not
understand the feelings, but also the attraction of another person.
Therefore, he is more careful, more afraid of being ridiculed. Men may
pose as anti-feminists, and women, especially if such attitude was
instilled by upbringing, also more or less openly show their contempt
for the questions of gender. In this “antifeminism” there is a
demonstrative element, behind which hides a search of permanent,
unchanging relations between human beings. This is not as much of a
statement that “All women are worthless”, as much as it is a question
“Can she continue to love me?”.</p>

<p>Sensory-logical extrovert (SLE), like all extroverts, does not like it
when initiatives originate from other people. Any person who takes
excessive initiative - is uninteresting, irritating, boring, and
generally “not the one”. He tries not to demonstrate this and holds
himself in company politely (especially if woman), but feels himself
miserable, nonetheless. A person of this nature does not doubt that he
is entitled to the physical side of love, but only if he seeks it
himself, and not if it is being imposed on him. Desire, striving for
physical identification with another person, is a phenomenon
understandable and common. It is an irrevocable part of his nature. His
weak point - is feelings. Evaluating others by his own standards, he
knows and does not doubt that he can be desired, but he is rarely so
sure that he can also be loved. Desire - is a common method of his
self-realization. While love, psychological identification with another
person - this, in his view, is a luxury that is not available to
everyone. Thus, to talk of how he feels, while not being certain that
his partner values his feelings more than he does himself, he cannot do.
And if he blurts out a mention, he feels as if he has betrayed himself.
He’s afraid of love, not as psychological identification with the other,
but as an illicit desire, an undeserved luxury. He is afraid not only of
love, but also of many other feelings. He himself is sure, as are his
friends and people who are close to him, that he doesn’t know fear,
hatred, etc. He doesn’t get surprised nor feel envious of others.</p>
<p>Emotionally, the sensory-logical extrovert feels open only with
intuitive-ethical introvert (IEI) who, on the one hand, is sufficiently
emotional himself, well aware of the feelings of others people and does
not hide his own, and on another hand - makes an impression of being
helpless, lost in life individual. Only with such a person the
sensory-logical extravert can feel certain that his feelings won’t be
ridiculed. Even if he is rejected - it will seem so helpless and
far-fetched, that it won’t hurt or offend. In addition, sensory-logical
extrovert is impressed by sexual restraint of a partner as a
precondition for seriousness of feelings and constancy.</p>
<p>It is often said that a man looks for female weakness, as he’s not
afraid to show his own weakness only to the weak. This is wrong. Some
people - as far as it concerns different types of IM - are not weaker
than the others. The same can be said about the relationship between
these two persons. The strength of sensory-logical extrovert in his
energy, his capacity for logical conclusions, and renunciation of his
feelings. His weakness is in his effort to avoid showing feelings. The
power of intuitive-ethical introvert in his adaptation to other people
and ability to manipulate their emotions. Only the sensory-logical
extrovert may think that a loving woman draws him by her helplessness,
because feelings, which the intuitive-ethical introvert doesn’t hide,

<p>Sensory-ethical extravert (SEE) not only doesn’t hide his feelings, but,
on the contrary, he is proud of them. He relatively easy expresses his
admirations, if it matches his own mood, and does so by both his words
and his look. He is always for complete love, for both physical and
psychological identification, if only if he needs it. Even if the
feeling is short-lived. He knows very well what he wants from the object
of his love. Not inclined to adapt to them, only dictate.</p>
<p>Sensory-ethical extravert, like all sensory types, pays much attention
to the aesthetics of the environment, cleanliness, order. Frequently he
possesses what is called an innate sense of taste, knows how to dress
well and seeks the same from people around him. He is attentive to the
external physical qualities of his partner. In activities and ventures
he’s very initiative-taking. At the same time, he doesn’t have a sense
of measure in what he is doing. Often feels unsure that he has done
everything that he could possibly do.</p>
<p>Life of the sensory-ethical extravert is complicated by the demands of
people close to him to think over his actions, to conduct himself
wisely. (Most often in this situation fall men, because they are less
interested in the logic of female behavior). The sensory-ethical
extravert responds poorly to this: such requests make him lose his
temper, and then he really stops considering any logic. In other words,
he acts intelligently and logically for as long as this is not asked of
him, for as long as he is “respected” and “considered”. One cannot argue
with his logic. Influencing him is only possible by setting other,
opposing to his goals objectives, that are more noble and harder to
reach.</p>
<p>The initiative-taking and proactive qualities of this type are so
abundant that no criticism, not even the constant nagging and grumbling
of the intuitive-logical introvert, who judges almost any activity or
action undertaken by anyone else, can ruin his mood. To the contrary,
criticism calms him down, shows him what he has done and that he has
accomplished a lot, that his activity is being noticed and paid
attention. These people lack in self-critical ability when it comes to
their work and engagements, not because they overestimate them, but
because they underestimate them. Others suspect them of wanting to be in
the center of attention, while all that they really need is to feel that
this “chaos” that surrounds them from all sides they are bringing to
some kind of order, that they are overcoming it.</p>
<p>Due to their proactiveness and demanding attitude, sensing-ethical
extroverts often become disappointed or frustrated with the objects of
their feelings. They turn to be “not what they sought”, not sufficiently
resonant with the call of their spirit and soul. And the main point here
is that they need a kind of person to whom they can adapt without
adapting. Of such a person everyone dreams. This is how a female
student, by the name of Ruta, describes the “knight of her dreams”: “He
must be handsome and somewhat melancholic (like the protagonist of H.
Hesse’s novel “Steppenwolf”). With big sad eyes, not talkative. He
doesn’t tell compliments, and by that he creates an impression of being
unapproachable. He is taunted by myriads of problems, which, in my
opinion are nothing to be bothered with. I am attracted by his sadness,
seriousness, so I try to amuse him, to raise his spirits, to make him
happy. If such a boy is present at a party, I wouldn’t be bored, but I
become lively and cheerful, try if not make him laugh then at least make
him smile.” This is a figurative description of the intuitive-logical
introvert, who in his feelings is very constant, not inclined to
adventures, and can be completely dependent on the demands on his loved
person. For a long time he doesn’t trust the attention from another,
waits for proof, thus he appears to be unattainable and serious, which
is so much needed by his energetic, insistent, tired of his own
inconstancy partner, the sensory-ethical extrovert.</p>
<p>The main characteristic of intuitive-logical introvert - he not only
himself rarely takes initiative, which in general is typical of almost
all introverts, but he also makes fun of those who show any activity, if
it can be done without. All these active individuals, they say, climb
onto the stage, wanting to be in the center of attention, and burst from
their own stupidity. Some take this as a sober view point, objective
independent evaluation, courage to say unpleasant things. Others he sets
against himself and makes enemies, as everywhere and always he manages
to drop a bit of tar. This type was interestingly characterized by Erich
Fromm (he even called it necrophiliac, that is, those who love death):
“You can spot him, - he wrote, - by the expression on his face: he looks
as if he’s sniffing out a foul odor, has an extraordinary ability to
deaden, to extinguish everything he touches; boring in interaction,
where he appears, any liveliness drowns, any conversations fade out; he
is attracted by all non-living things, all that is painful, dead, or
mechanical.” Erich Fromm himself - is an intuitive-logical extravert
i.e. the opposite of the intuitive-logical introvert. Between them there
are no common points and attitudes in perception of the world. If the
intuitive introvert told of his opinion about a preacher of optimistic
philosophy - intuitive extrovert - it would have sounded no less
colorful. (Even when people of contrary type of IMs sympathize with each
other, they do not understand the motives of the activity of the other.
Hence the distrust). While for those who need them for psychological
complimentarity (e.g. the descriptions of the female student Ruta of a
guy of her dreams), this type is the bearer of peace of mind and
especially deep intellect.</p>
<p>An interesting characteristic of the intuitive-logical introvert -
acquiescence, yielding attitude. He loves strong people, who know their
road and who demand concessions, people who relieve him from having to
come up with goals, while making use of his invented methods of action.
But he yields only in the case when he considers that it will be wiser,
or needed, otherwise it can’t be. To put it another way, he acts
willingly only when he can say with a clear conscience that he was
forced to act, that there was no other way, no way out. In erotic
relations people people of this type are even more passive than in any
other endeavor. All initiative lies in the hands of a partner, while he
“yields” because he cannot act otherwise. He takes actions when the
opposite would be stupid, when circumstances, reason, understanding
warrant it, when getting married is in some respects necessary, correct
course of action.</p>
<p>Intuitive introvert is inclined to pessimistic philosophizing. Not
seldom he gets called a misanthrope. Sometimes, an impression arises
that he generally sees only black, and that he himself - is an evil and
a bad being. No, this is not so. He simply lives all the time with
apprehension, fearing that he might overlook something. If of some
impending trouble or treat (good luck is of lesser interest to him) he
does not warn in advance, apparently, he would have felt himself
superfluous.</p>
<p>When these people do something with enthusiasm, most often the possible
failures become forgotten. Upon seeing a good mood, the introverted
intuition begins to remind its owner that there is nothing to rejoice
to, that this is accessible to any fool, and that it’s not yet clear
what will come out of this - and the mood is spoiled, any passions fade.
However, this makes him an unsurpassed comforter when others have no
luck, when everything falls out of the hands, when fate seems hostile.
The bottom line is that this type is afraid of any extroverted emotions:
he is irritated by both joyful moods, which to him seem as a kind of
mask or camouflage that obscures the true essence of things, and any
despairing moods and tragedies. Thus, he extinguishes them. He himself
cannot act under the dictation of his emotions, hence the rejection of
demonstrations of sensitivity and a tendency to look at any people who
allow themselves to be such as self-centered children, whom it is useful
to occasionally return to earthly reality. This is what is need to the
sensory-ethical extravert. After all, it’s so great when a loving person
can think in advance about possible tricks of the fate, when with his
warnings he protects from any attack or surprise, and if a disaster is
near, he is able to show the relativity of its evil over time.</p>
<p>In addition, it must be said that his caustic remarks don’t ruin the
mood of people who are satisfied with the quality of their work. And
most sensing types have this kind of self-assurance. The words
“otherwise it couldn’t be,” “you can’t jump higher than your own nose,”
which for an individual with extroverted intuition would feel like a
condemnation, only calm down the very energetic ethical-sensory
extrovert. They convince him that this is not his fault if more hasn’t
been done. The same words act as morally soothing to one, while they
sound like a reproach to another.</p>
<p>Intuitive-logical introvert from smaller aspects and details of actions
and behavior of another person creates a working model of them.
Therefore, most things don’t surprise him. Hence, he experiences a

<p>Intuitive-logical extrovert, like all other extroverts, do not like
attention from others, which exceeds its own initiative. Friends he
chooses. He does not like nor compliant, which he seems uncertain, nor
those who use other concessions. But as a rule, inferior, and it does
not. Is extremely poor tactician. Not only is he able to set the desired
distance from people, but has no idea what it should be. Can not be
angry, stubborn, to defend their interests. Therefore, those who try to
use it not for the sake of a new standing and complicated and
interesting case, which is his passion, but for the sake of someone’s
personal “selfish” interests, is trying to annoy the right. And so often
known bad character.</p>
<p>Concessions and services do not like it. But what makes for the case,
even when doing for others, does not consider the assignment. “For
others” is not an “other.” Feelings for him - a taboo, and from them to
run. Should be no doubt that every act is the result of an objective,
logical, rather than subjective ethical thinking.</p>
<p>Intuitive-logical extravert sees the objective capabilities of its
partners (but not their feelings). Is extremely sensitive, where
carelessness can weaken the vitality of another person. He likes the
stubborn, very well knowing what they want, and at the same time funny,
warm, quiet touch introverts. He is a man of his word, do what promised,
even if it turns out to be unprofitable. His passion - caring for the
creation of conditions for the vitality of others. Supports the
activities of all people, guided by the peculiar sense supports the
objective of duty, rather than emotions.</p>
<p>Appealing to the sense of duty (as well as any other feeling) knocks off
balance, and causes the bristles to rebel. Relationships with them
deteriorate as soon as a hint to the need to perform duty, but before
that they could do much more than is consistent with common sense and
normal practicality.</p>
<p>Intuitive-logical extravert and no one ever accuses. Reproach - that
means to confess to feeling. This is beyond his power. He thinks that
man right there is no right to reproach. Recriminations from both fear
and any signs of aggressiveness in the face of which is enraged. He
already uses too much power to suppress feelings. On the call, ie any
criticism - often says, “If so, then I is not needed” and leaves,
slamming the door. But these states of uncontrolled fear, trying to
avoid. One reason for the peculiar desire to overdo it in any action is
to avoid casual allusions to the debt, and thereby losing control over
their relationships with people.</p>
<p>In the erotic feelings are very restrained. The situation is complicated
by extraversion, which can not succumb to the will and initiative of
others. Sensitive feelings hard to ripen. For a long time doubted,
compares, thinks. Sometimes you need a year or two to yourself, do not
hesitate to say “I love you.” Even harder to show it differently.
Therefore, if possible, these people are trying to get rid of the
feeling that in the eyes of another does not seem ridiculous, weak,
dependent and void. In the feelings of his partner and the emotional
reality is completely unversed. Suppose, after he himself explains that
feeling - a product of his imagination, the memory comes up a lot of
evidence Choice favorite. But as soon as this will be overjoyed and
decides that the fight with a stupid memory provides it with the same
amount of proof to the contrary sense. Love - timeless, raging in the
mind of a hurricane. Continuous delirium, when nothing else can not do
and nothing else to think about. (This is one of the most dangerous
variants of platonic love). To talk about feelings only undertake when
the realize that they have evolved into a chronic disease that must be
treated. I wonder what they can not get rid of them until there is no
certainty (and only for as long as its not) in a retaliatory sense.
Spiritual balance is restored as soon disappears ambiguity, that is,
when an object is specifically waives his likes or accepts them.
Intuitive-logical extravert because of the love object will never
compete. If you are a person who seems more worthy of attention other
inferior without nagging sense of regret - because he tries to subdue
his life logic. But if the object of love after a while back, nothing
but gratitude for him is not felt.</p>
<p>All intuitive extrovert at home distracted, inattentive, it is difficult
to get along with the world of things and if they live alone, around
there is chaos, to which they feel helpless. This weakness know how and
what others can not be so tired of their care of others.</p>
<p>In partners fully suitable only friendly, always good and optimistic
sensory-ethical introvert (actor Leonov, Dumas).</p>
<p>Intuitive-logical extravert does not say “I love you” or “Be mine.” He
was happy to have abdicated from their feelings as no one else desired
weakness, but too well aware that this is ruining it. Therefore, his
inner mood, of which he is inclined to be silent, the most consistent of
the word “I will destroy you.” When he feels that is on the verge of a
precipice, and his personality is facing complete disaster, says, “I
need you” and that - God forbid - do not cheat in something else, opens
his eyes to all its shortcomings, so that he would not buy a cat in the
bag. “I need” convincing explanation for ear sensory-ethical introvert,
which his emotions behind his short, to whom these words - the best of
all possible evaluations of his personality. To whom his emotions is not
enough, these words came to dry and unconvincing. Even hurt to.</p>
<p>Touch is an introvert hedonist more than any other and therefore only
feels good reality of his physical existence. Since each of the other
inclined to judge for himself, he thinks so, and feels different.
Therefore, it is considered a comfort of others, considerate and caring,
when they were sympathetic. At the very least, making this type - not a
burden on others. He can not ask for nor require service all their needs
trying to satisfy their own. Something for which sensory introvert
extrovert intuitive as needed, can be called a special sensitivity and
subtlety, attention to the physical “I” of the other. Protecting the
world of his feelings, guards and others. Sensory-ethical introvert good
tactician. In everyday life, is able to defend its sovereignty, that is,
he needed distance from people, and not to spoil the relationship that
just does not work in intuitive-logical extravert. In addition, sensory
introvert has its own dynamic rhythm of everyday life, which is just not
enough second, and without which he feels like ivy without support.</p>
<p>Sensory-ethical introvert feels very good in the world of feelings and
emotions. Perceptive to the feelings of others. It is easy to
distinguish who is and how it likes and wants. This type of artist who
appreciates life in all its varieties. He loves beauty and harmony.
Creates them. If something does, does with feeling and taste. For each
object on the work looks like a work of art which should excite others
and himself. Even if it’s cooking. In love, he is also an artist. If the
object of love is not enough attentive, knows how relatively easy to
remove, replace it with another. These desires and needs are very well
aware of and responsibility for them not to shift the other partner.
This is exactly what is needed most intuitive logical extrovert, who is
himself on his own initiative or believe in feelings, not abandon them
can not.</p>

<div class="section" id="the-second-dyad-intuitive-ethical-extravert-iee-ne-fi-and-sensory-logical-introvert-sli-si-te">
<span id="iee-sli-aushra"></span><h4><strong>The second dyad: intuitive ethical extravert (IEE : Ne-Fi) and sensory logical introvert (SLI : Si-Te)</strong><a class="headerlink" href="#the-second-dyad-intuitive-ethical-extravert-iee-ne-fi-and-sensory-logical-introvert-sli-si-te" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Intuitive-ethical extravert their feeling quite shy, and knows how much
to seek. But precisely because, like all intuitive, trying to bypass the
drive. His speech about love and longing passionate, seductive glances
and smiles. But his affection hesitant, cautious, more addicted,
seductive and asking than giving and demanding. Kissing incorporeal
touch as a butterfly. More of this on his own initiative he can not go
and does not know how to drive in the presence of a partner is
uncertain, it is always better to know what he wants other than himself.
Hence the fear of becoming dependent on another, and the fear of being
ignorant or rude in a caress.</p>
<p>The greatest pleasure of all intuitive extroverts, both ethical and
logical, to find a way out of the provisions that seem hopeless to
others. Very often live, allowing themselves quite useless problems.
Intuitive-ethical extravert particularly emotional situations available
solution. Through understanding the spiritual structure of the people,
they know how to please, and can not refrain from doing so. So, enjoy
exceptional success among individuals of the opposite sex. Because of
what - especially considering that his attention trying to make happy
each - quite often a reputation for being very frivolous people and get
the nickname Don Juan. It has long been established that the so-called
philanderers like love women, they have enjoyed great success and yet
afraid of intimacy, at the last moment “disappointed” in his beloved.
Some therapists explained that their sexual coldness, others by the fact
that every woman they are trying to find his mother, and others that
they need only a victory over other men, as was evident that more
attention is paid to women with a husband or even a lover . But the
thing is, apparently, that attract the attention of a married more
complicated and therefore more interesting problem.</p>
<p>So, intuitively-ethical extravert their feelings rather unstable because
of its rough character, which is dictated by extraversion and ability to
attract people. In European culture, his sexual restraint plus ardor
feeling extremely impressed by the women. They are close and
understandable emotional courage, initiative and Don Juan at the same
time his “harmless”, which each divines advance. In addition, under two
levels of spiritual culture, “high” - a male and a “lower” - female,
woman, only men are flattered by the attention to her body, and its
spiritual life.</p>
<p>To his mind the physical identification - giving up control over the
situation, the complete equation with a partner - surrender. As a
result, often fleeing the physical, mental, and of identification, but
it is difficult to give up “solutions to complex situations.” He needs a
tough, closed, but its attraction and business thinking completely
trusting woman. That is - the sensory-logical introvert. If the IR meets
the woman of this type is not too late, before the individual may still
abandon their emotional power over all and sexual freedom of all
journeys end in Don Juan. Then say, “and who could have thought that he
would one day become serious.”Sensory-logical introvert feels fine as
close to nature, and at home. If he needs something, knows how to do
what he wants, without advice from others. Defined sequence in the
propensity to care for their comfort. Movement of calm, precise,
extremely economical. When viewed from the side usually gives the
impression that the outcome of their work is always greater than the
effort. As if part of the movement is hidden from the observer’s eye. It
is characterized by the ability to take from the environment that it can
give without demanding what is not.</p>
<p>All sensory introvert inherent trait - do not show on his face and his
real feelings, so do not give the other party about his inner world.</p>
<p>Sensory-logical introvert is almost always the same cold and mysterious,
sensory-ethical - the same warm, caring, smiling.</p>
<p>If the intuitive-logical extravert afraid to show their feelings,
confess them, the sensory-logical introvert afraid to show emotion, and
by all means avoid dictated their actions.</p>
<p>In their dreams, sensory? Logical introvert bears the image of the ideal
partner that is most similar to the intuitive ethical extravert. Ele
student describes the knight of your dreams, “is beautiful, elegant, but
not a dandy, its looks are not paying attention. Movement uncertain, it
lacks precision, even a little clumsy. With great spiritualized,
wondering eyes. Knows no fear, full of good wishes, feelings and
determination. At any time, can throw all the ideas for a new sublime. I
want to be his friend, assistant and lover. ” Something like a fearless
Musketeers or sea captain from a fairy tale.</p>

<p>Born a new science Socionics , the science of nature shestnadtsatitipnoy
people and about the patterns of relations between them. This work is
dedicated to only one respect - respect additions. But since there are
sixteen types of people, and relations between them become sixteen
different forms. There is a relationship of identity, the activation of
the conflict, control, social order, and many others. Some of them act
positively on the human psyche, such as the ratio of activation, the
other - a relationship of conflict, control - in the negative. All this
is described in another paper in the “Theory of intertype relations”
(1982).</p>
<p>The main objective of this work - to show that the manifestations of
love, as in all other areas of human communication, there is no right
and wrong, good and bad. There are only people with appropriate and
inappropriate types of personality or - information metabolism (IM). In
addition, there are people with more balanced psyche. They are the ones
who succeed, who have grown up living and working among people with
suitable types of IM. And there are people with less balanced psyche.
They are the ones that failed because their environment is formed of
people with inappropriate types of myocardial infarction and the impact
it is destructive.</p>
<p>People have always dreamed of living on good terms with other people who
wanted to be understood and wanted to understand others. Wanted to see
the range of kindness and themselves to be benevolent. Dreamed of all,
it was possible a few. Today we know that it is impossible to dream of a
truly harmonious, peaceful and creative society and the individual, as
long as people do not understand its nature and underlying polytypic for
their types of patterns of communication. Completely new stage in the
life of society will this reorganization him that each person will
provide an opportunity for a sufficient number of contacts with the
right for his psychosomatic health of people.</p>
<p>It is difficult to say when this will come true dream, but there is no
other way.</p>
