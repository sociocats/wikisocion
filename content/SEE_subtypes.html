<h3>Description by V. Meged and A. Ovcharov<a class="headerlink" href="#description-by-v-meged-and-a-ovcharov" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p><strong>Appearance</strong></p>
<p>The sensory subtype is an authoritative, confident in himself,
emotional, and assertive person. Behind his inner restlessness hides a
constant thirst for vigorous activity. Inclined to take up too much and
frequently ends up wasting his strengths and energies in vain. Despite
his best efforts to be diplomatic, at times he’s too critical and
categorical. Often feels indignant, nonetheless doesn’t forget to give
compliments. Can look down at this conversation partner, act
patronizing, poke at him with prickly jokes. But can also be very kind
and courteous, and knows how to keep insisting and persuading someone
for a long time, if needed. Possess good artistic sensibilities. Knows
how to entertain people. Often he is somewhat thin, looks after his
figure, periodically takes up physical exercise and sports. Shifts and
changes poses frequently. Eyes are commonly not very large and deep
seated. His gestures are impatient, movements seem gusty and nervous.
Gait is relaxed or even somewhat shaky and muddled. Speech may be
rushed, slightly slurred and too fast.</p>
<p><strong>Character</strong></p>
<p>Has the character of a leader. Self-assured, brave, and active. Flexible
in changing his tactics. Orients quickly in a changing situation and
adopts creative approaches as events unfold. Energetic and sociable.
Knows how to strike up useful contacts. Has difficulty with accurately
evaluating abilities and capabilities of people in resolution of
concrete tasks, often experiences doubts and hesitation over this, which
he prefers not to share with others. Can lead a large team. Resolute in
extreme situations and quickly finds means to stabilize the situation.</p>
<p>Gravitates towards practical activity. Prefers near-lying, concrete
goals that bring some tangible benefits. Tries to improve his competence
in his occupation, to raise his own profile and prestige and strengthen
his position. In the interest of his business can exert strong pressure
on his partners, be overly demanding, and perseverant. The victory must
always be attributed to him. Despite the scatteredness of his interests,
he tries to bring the most important bulk of work or assignments to
completion.</p>
<p>Prefers to have freedom of action. Does not recognize strict regulation
and control. Dislikes monotony and routine. Due to his tendency towards
irritability, may fall into depression. Quickly grows tired of routine
and boredom, then seeks change and new experiences. Active and mobile,
tries to be always informed about current events.</p>
<p>Cautious in new ventures, as he doesn’t have a good sense of their
prospective future development. Mistrustful of new untested in practice
ideas. Strives to understand general patterns and laws that lie behind
topics and questions of interest to him, to soberly analyze the
situation. Gathers needed information, establishes necessary links,
consults with people who are more competent than him. Takes risks only
after weighting everything out, but then he acts quickly and decisively.
Has strong willpower, endurance, and perseverance in overcoming
difficulties, but in the interests of his business is able to agree to
temporary compromises.</p>
<p>Has a complex and problematic character. Demands that others need to
reckon with him, to recognize his authority, to respect him for his
business and personal qualities. Sensitive to criticism, admits his own
mistakes with great difficulty. Feeling offended by someone, does not
take advice, may even act the opposite. Very vulnerable and
insufficiently self-critical, thus only praises of his merits and
abilities can encourage him to activity.</p>
<p>Emotional, impulsive. Due to rapid changes of moods is unpredictable in
his behavior: at times he is artistic and demonstrative, other times he
is wary, prickly, and provocative. Passes on his moods to people around
him. if he is in high spirits, can infect everyone with his optimism,
cheer them up with original antics, and inspire any activity; if he is
in a bad mood, he prefers to be alone, or to socialize with people who
can give him their attention and sympathies. At such times, he is
inclined to over-dramatize events. But can bring himself under control
despite his soulful discomfort when he needs to find a way out of a
crisis situation.</p>
<p>Expressive with his feelings. Knows how to deliver compliments. However,
for educational purposes, he criticizes more often than he praises, but
tries to do it in half-joking manner. As a result of his
impressionability, as well as the contradictory nature of his character,
it is rare that he achieves an inner balance. Finds it difficult to
maintain smooth and stable relationships with other people. In his heart
and soul he is a maximalist, and expects more than he can achieve. Thus,
he is inclined to often feel disappointed in people who were initially
sympathetic to him.</p>

<div class="section" id="description-by-victor-gulenko">
<h3>Description by Victor Gulenko<a class="headerlink" href="#description-by-victor-gulenko" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Very active, pressing ahead, enterprising person. Always “holds his
sails to the wind”. Inclined to venturism, to plays on differences of
prices, to risks and games with the law. If he suffers a defeat, he
easily withdraws, putting forward other, less flexible partners. This is
one of the most unpredictable types. Easily works in trade and mediatory
structures, but not in production lines. Sharp changes in moods are
characteristic of him: if he feels himself good, then everyone must feel
good too, but if he feels himself bad then others must suffer it as
well. Strikes up friendships with people at closer personal distances.
Can create massive emotional pressuring. A good manager of his
household. Can realize himself in service jobs, for example as a waiter
at a restaurant, and as an actor, but only of light genres such as
comedy or operetta. Easily manipulates with relations, bringing other
people closer or farther away from him. Emotionally unstable, for this
reason often cannot coexist with others in peace. In case of failure can
quickly cause a provocation, then retreat into the shadow.</p>
