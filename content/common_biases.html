<h1>Common biases in socionics<a class="headerlink" href="#common-biases-in-socionics" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>One of the challenges in creating objective statements about Socionics
is that the very nature of the field invites the potential for bias. For
a simple demonstration, consider someone trying to ascertain another
persons strong <a class="reference internal" href="elements.html"><span class="doc">IM elements</span></a> by asking “What do you
think you can do better than everybody else?” The question itself
reflects a competitive nature, which may not be equally shared by all
people. Furthermore, it is likely that some types would phrase this
question differently from others; and similarly, some socionic types
would have an easier time responding to the question when phrased that
way.</p>
<p>Categories of potential causes for systemic biases in socionics include
those shown in the table of contents below.</p>
<div class="section" id="type-quadra-or-dichotomy-centric-biases">
<h2>Type, quadra, or dichotomy-centric biases<a class="headerlink" href="#type-quadra-or-dichotomy-centric-biases" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Work by socionics theorists of a particular type or quadra may be
subject to point-of-view biases inherent to their own type or
<a class="reference internal" href="quadra.html"><span class="doc">quadra</span></a>. For example, because <a class="reference internal" href="augusta.html"><span class="doc">Augusta</span></a> and
other prominent <a class="reference internal" href="socionist.html"><span class="doc">Socionists</span></a> are from the
<a class="reference internal" href="alpha_quadra.html"><span class="doc">Alpha</span></a> quadra, their work has sometimes been suspected of
reflecting an Alpha bias. Likewise, <a class="reference internal" href="vera.html"><span class="doc">Vera Stratievskaya</span></a>’s type descriptions are in turn
sometimes suspected of reflecting a <a class="reference internal" href="gamma_quadra.html"><span class="doc">Gamma</span></a> bias since her own
type is <a class="reference internal" href="ESI.html"><span class="doc">ESI</span></a>.</p>
<div class="section" id="alpha-centrism">
<h3>Alpha-centrism<a class="headerlink" href="#alpha-centrism" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>An example of possible Alpha bias is that descriptions of <img alt="symbol_l.gif" src="../_images/symbol_l.gif"/>
and <img alt="symbol_i.gif" src="../_images/symbol_i.gif"/> are often described in what seem to some people to be
broader, more encompassing terms than the <a class="reference internal" href="elements.html"><span class="doc">IM elements</span></a>
of <a class="reference internal" href="gamma_quadra.html"><span class="doc">Gamma</span></a>, being the opposing quadra. For example
<img alt="symbol_l.gif" src="../_images/symbol_l.gif"/> is sometimes described as related to the use of logic and
understanding, as well as organization, whereas <img alt="symbol_p.gif" src="../_images/symbol_p.gif"/> is often
described enigmatically as related to “business logic” or random,
disconnected facts.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="symbol-i-gif-bias">
<h3><img alt="symbol_i.gif" src="../_images/symbol_i.gif"/> bias<a class="headerlink" href="#symbol-i-gif-bias" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Similarly, <img alt="symbol_i.gif" src="../_images/symbol_i.gif"/> is often described as relating to ideas,
insight, and intellectual interest in general, whereas <img alt="symbol_t.gif" src="../_images/symbol_t.gif"/> is
often described more enigmatically as related to “time.” It is very
likely <a class="reference internal" href="augusta.html"><span class="doc">Augusta</span></a> increased the territory of <img alt="symbol_i.gif" src="../_images/symbol_i.gif"/>
in comparison to other <a class="reference internal" href="elements.html"><span class="doc">IM elements</span></a> to reflect the most
outstanding qualities of herself and other <a class="reference internal" href="ILE.html"><span class="doc">ILEs</span></a> around her.
For example, here are a few lines about leading <img alt="symbol_i.gif" src="../_images/symbol_i.gif"/> from her
work <em>The Socion, or Socionics Basics</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>“When this element is in the leading position, the individual has
pronounced cognitive interests. He is constantly studying underlying
phenomena, which he is able to communicate to others quite
successfully by making complicated things simple. Likes to explain to
others his understanding of things. In favorable conditions becomes a
scientist or writer”
<cite>1 &lt;http://www.socionics.us/works/socion2.shtml&gt;</cite></p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The rest of the description is probably objective, but this section
above would apply to many people of other types with pronounced
intellectual interests. Over time this bias seems to have weakened in
Russian socionics, and statements such as Augusta’s are now rare among
publishing socionists. However, in forums and informal discussions they
are sometimes brought up by amateurs who have picked up the bias from
socionics literature.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ile-bias">
<h3>ILE bias<a class="headerlink" href="#ile-bias" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The <a class="reference internal" href="ILE.html"><span class="doc">ILE</span></a> bias comes from <a class="reference internal" href="augusta.html"><span class="doc">Augusta</span></a> herself and is
closely related to the one above. According to Augusta’s original
conception of type roles, <a class="reference internal" href="ILE.html"><span class="doc">ILEs</span></a> were seen as being a type that
sees the hidden roots of phenomena (supposedly <img alt="symbol_i.gif" src="../_images/symbol_i.gif"/>) and
arranges them into a system or theory (<img alt="symbol_l.gif" src="../_images/symbol_l.gif"/>). For many years
<a class="reference internal" href="augusta.html"><span class="doc">Augusta</span></a> and her associates assumed that scientists and
thinkers who generated new theories were <a class="reference internal" href="ILE.html"><span class="doc">ILEs</span></a> (people like
Einstein, Bohr,
Newton, and Darwin). Later,
she and others seemed to recognize this mistake, but the ILE bias has
still not been completely undone. Just as “health” does not equate
exactly to <img alt="symbol_s.gif" src="../_images/symbol_s.gif"/>, “theory” does not equate exactly to
<img alt="symbol_l.gif" src="../_images/symbol_l.gif"/>, and people of different types may tend to generate
theories of a slightly different nature.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="intuitive-bias">
<h3>Intuitive bias<a class="headerlink" href="#intuitive-bias" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>In popular socionics, intellectual inquisitiveness and a focus on “the
big picture” is often associated with <a class="reference internal" href="sensing_intuition.html"><span class="doc">intuition</span></a>, while
<a class="reference internal" href="sensing_intuition.html"><span class="doc">sensing</span></a> is associated with a “focus on details” or a
preoccupation with “the here and now.” While such a division may appear
to be true for many or most people, intellectual sensers may not
identify with the image presented by some descriptions of
<a class="reference internal" href="sensing_intuition.html"><span class="doc">sensing</span></a>. Such popular descriptions add attributes shared
by most or all highly <a class="reference internal" href="intelligence.html"><span class="doc">intelligent</span></a> people to the
“intuitive” category, leading to possible systematic <a class="reference internal" href="diagnosis.html"><span class="doc">typing</span></a>
errors.</p>

<div class="section" id="misinterpreting-the-behavior-of-other-types">
<h2>Misinterpreting the behavior of other types<a class="headerlink" href="#misinterpreting-the-behavior-of-other-types" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This category is similar to type- or quadra-related bias. However, here,
the issue is that in describing a given type, one may notice behaviors
that appear foreign. Hence, one’s description of a given type may
reflect how odd or mysterious that type seems to oneself.</p>
<p><strong>Examples</strong> One possible example is the common assertion that ILIs are
predisposed against new ideas because of their being new. A number of
factors may create this impression from the perspective of other types,
such as that ILIs may:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>View criticism as being an important form of contribution, which may
have the effect of making it seem that they don’t like the idea
they’re criticizing</p></li>
<li><p>Tend not to display enthusiasm to the degree of other types (because
of <a class="reference internal" href="function_dich.html#valued"><span class="std std-ref">subdued</span></a> <a class="reference internal" href="Fe.html"><span class="doc">Fe</span></a>)</p></li>
<li><p>Not want their primary role to be in the area of practical
implementation, including implementation of other people’s ideas</p></li>
<li><p>Take too little initiative in promoting their own ideas</p></li>
<li><p>Be perfectionistic about their own ideas and therefore resentful when
people with less honed ideas get more attention for them</p></li>
</ul>
<p>A combination of these factors may cause ILIs to seem predisposed
against new ideas when that may not necessarily be the case.</p>

<div class="section" id="national-and-cultural-biases">
<h2>National and cultural biases<a class="headerlink" href="#national-and-cultural-biases" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>

<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><strong>Russian vs. Western views</strong></div>
<div class="line">Competing typologies, such as the <a class="reference internal" href="MBTI.html"><span class="doc">MBTI</span></a> theory, which
developed in the U.S. are sometimes described by Russian Socionists as
too optimistic, showing too little of the dark side of the various
types. In contrast, people from the West may be surprised by the
degree to which Socionics types are described as melancholic. This
difference may reflect differences in the degree to which people in
different cultures tend to express melancholy, morose, pensive
characteristics in public–or, on the contrary, the degree to which
they are conditioned by their culture to express bright, optimistic
qualities. In addition, socionics types’s “weaknesses” as perceived by
other types, usually reflecting the super-ego functions, are a central
part of the socionics conception of types, while <a class="reference internal" href="MBTI.html"><span class="doc">MBTI</span></a>
descriptions tend to focus only on each type’s “strengths”, an
approach that Russian socionists tend to see as too “politically
correct” and avoiding of a frank discussion of the types.</div>

<div class="section" id="passing-on-descriptive-elements-without-fully-knowing-their-source">
<h2>Passing on descriptive elements without fully knowing their source<a class="headerlink" href="#passing-on-descriptive-elements-without-fully-knowing-their-source" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Many type descriptions contain similar phrases about very specific
behaviors that have no connection to the position of
<a class="reference internal" href="functions.html"><span class="doc">functions</span></a> in <a class="reference internal" href="model_a.html"><span class="doc">Model A</span></a>. A famous example is
a phrase from <a class="reference internal" href="weisband.html"><span class="doc">Weisband’s</span></a> early descriptions that
<a class="reference internal" href="LIE.html"><span class="doc">LIEs</span></a> are “inclined towards alpinism.” If these don’t reference
specific studies supporting them, then it becomes very difficult to
ascertain the validity of such statements. Potentially, an observation
made on a small number of people may get copied from description to
description and hence become “standard” in type descriptions (or
descriptions of other groupings), hence perpetuating a somewhat biased
understanding. Collective discussion and criticism lessens the frequency
of these “random” tidbits.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="associating-specific-interests-and-topic-areas-with-types">
<h2>Associating specific interests and topic areas with types<a class="headerlink" href="#associating-specific-interests-and-topic-areas-with-types" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A kind of bias related to the other categories comes from describing
types, quadras, and IM elements in terms of specific interests and topic
areas. For example, a person might associate interest in the arts with
being an ethical type, interest in pure sciences with being an Alpha NT,
and interest in applied sciences with being a Gamma NT. While some
people regard these socionic “stereotypes” as completely valid, others
point out that they’re also inaccurate for a number of people.</p>
<p>One problem with this kind of type-interest linkage is that it fails to
take into account the roles other IM elements may play within in a
particular interest. For example, it is commonly suggested that an
interest in health is related to <img alt="symbol_s.gif" src="../_images/symbol_s.gif"/>. However, when one
thinks of the breadth of activities that may be related to health, it
becomes apparent that many different functions might be involved:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Gathering and analyzing the latest research on nutrition</p></li>
<li><p>Predicting global trends related to world health</p></li>
<li><p>Coming up with innovative solutions to health problems</p></li>
<li><p>Developing formulas for maintaining good health</p></li>
<li><p>Fostering relationships for good psychological health</p></li>
<li><p>Using spiritual or emotional means to influence physiological health</p></li>
</ul>
<p>By considering the breadth of what’s involved in “health,” it becomes
clear that more IM elements than <img alt="symbol_s.gif" src="../_images/symbol_s.gif"/> may be involved.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="describing-socionic-categories-using-language-that-is-foreign-to-that-category">
<h2>Describing socionic categories using language that is foreign to that category<a class="headerlink" href="#describing-socionic-categories-using-language-that-is-foreign-to-that-category" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The authors of <a class="reference internal" href="semantic_aspects.html"><span class="doc">The Semantics of the Information Aspects</span></a> found that many
existing descriptions of <a class="reference internal" href="information_aspect.html"><span class="doc">information aspects</span></a>
used language that did not resonate with the aspects themselves. For
example, many descriptions of <img alt="symbol_t.gif" src="../_images/symbol_t.gif"/> contain the word
“mysticism,” which did not resonate with individuals with <img alt="symbol_t.gif" src="../_images/symbol_t.gif"/>
as a strong function. “Mysticism” was an external interpretation of the
interests and behaviors of types with strong <img alt="symbol_t.gif" src="../_images/symbol_t.gif"/>, but was not
how these types themselves perceived things.</p>
<p>Other examples may be when sensers are described as being “focused only
on the here and now,” or intuiters as being “impractical.” The first
sounds like something an intuitive type would say about sensers, while
the second sounds like what a sensing type might think about many
intuiters.</p>
<p>It could be argued that describing Socionics categories from the
perspective of how those of an opposing category may describe them is
legitimate, valuable information. The bias comes if this isn’t done
evenly for every category (i.e., if some categories are described from
an internal viewpoint, and others from a more external viewpoint).
Research on how people of different categories describe themselves and
are described by people of other categories, and clearly annotated
information based on such research, may help in overcoming such bias.</p>

in other settings may be overlooked. For example, the impression is
created that relations between <a class="reference internal" href="quadra.html"><span class="doc">opposing quadras</span></a>
are adversarial; however, in many settings these relations may be more
agreeable than predicted (especially <a class="reference internal" href="extinguishment.html"><span class="doc">Contrary</span></a> and
<a class="reference internal" href="superego.html"><span class="doc">Super-Ego relations</span></a>). In an atmosphere that
emphasizes purely intellectual discussion and doesn’t require emotional
or practical support, <a class="reference internal" href="alpha_quadra.html"><span class="doc">Alpha</span></a> and <a class="reference internal" href="gamma_quadra.html"><span class="doc">Gamma</span></a> NT types
may find a certain complementarity.</p>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="duality.html"><span class="doc">Duality</span></a> is emphasized in Socionics because it involves
complementarity at all levels. However, other relationships have their
own merits.</p>
