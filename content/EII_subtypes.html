<h2>Intuitive subtype Ne-INFj (Ne-EII)<a class="headerlink" href="#intuitive-subtype-ne-infj-ne-eii" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<div class="section" id="id1">
<h3>Description by V. Meged and A. Ovcharov<a class="headerlink" href="#id1" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p><strong>Appearance</strong></p>
<p>The intuitive subtype is emotional, composed, and firm. Shows
cordiality, goodwill, and friendliness toward people who are in his
favor. Closing distance with a person tries to be somehow useful and of
service. Likes to advise, to mentor, to educate others but only within
his circle. Possesses figurative and imaginative thinking and creative
abilities, can discuss various imagery, symbols, dreams. Sensitive,
vulnerable, uncertain and erratic. Prone to taking offense despite his
best attempts to hide this. Sometimes he likes to joke around in
conversation. Tries not to say unpleasant things to people, but cannot
always restrain himself and may burst out in disagreement or
indignation, but comes to regret it later. Serious and fastidious,
prefers to hold himself with some reserve and subtlety. Dresses simply,
adhering to classical styles, often conservatively. His mimicry and
gestures are weakly expressed. Speech is emotional and slightly

become convinced of the verity of his partner’s statements.</p>
<p>Poorly tolerates loneliness, needs attention of people who are close
with him. Appreciates sincerity, attention to his person, and tact;
condemns discordant and abusive behavior. Quite principled; he believes
that all-forgiveness corrupts those who deserve to be punished. May
sometimes deliver a harsh rebuke for a person whom he thinks to be
guilty, but usually wavers before doing so because he is afraid of
spoiling his relations with other people and being unfair. Loves his
family; he is ready for any sacrifices for them. Very fond of small
children; though sometimes for educational purposes he is strict and
uncompromising in their treatment. At times advocates for harsh measures
and punishments.</p>
<p>Impressionable and emotionally sensitive. Feels truly satisfied with
himself only if he could contribute by a deed. Tries to please others by
performing a variety of services for them or giving presents, by being
generous and unselfish. Helps people not sparing his time and efforts,
meanwhile may forget about himself. Does not forgive betrayal and
treachery; in such cases may irreversibly put an end to the
relationship. Easily takes offense. Painfully and sensitively perceives
the lack of volitional, push-through qualities in himself.</p>
<p>Takes on many tasks barely completing them on time, thus may postpone
unpleasant or uninteresting work until later. Shows an interest in the
objective side of affairs if he has a desire to become competent in
pragmatic activities, in which case makes himself learn about procedures
and regulations. Can be happy if he finds a proper application of his
abilities.</p>
<p>A person of firm convictions - an idealist and a maximalist. Dreams of
being in ideal harmony with his partner in tastes, beliefs, and
passions, and becomes upset when this doesn’t happen and disagreements
arise. Due to his tendency to take everything close to heart, feels
worried and agitated by slighted occasions. Prone to doubt, somewhat
indecisive and diffident. Needs an optimistically oriented partner who
can dispel his worries and uncertainties, be able to provide an
evaluation of his work and actions, shield him from unnecessary tasks
and people, and improve his mood. Has a keen sense of responsibility for
others. Demanding of himself; educates others by his personal example.
Tries to instill in other people consideration for human values. May
have an interest in occult or religious and teach himself various
divination techniques and interpretations of teachings.</p>
<p>His appearance is often very modest, dresses so as not to stand out.
Attempts to look tidy and well-groomed, but investing effort and time
into looking after his appearance feels like a burden for him. Often
doesn’t have much interest in jewelry. Critically evaluates his looks;
negative remarks on this topic can deeply wound him. Receives
compliments in the presence of others with confusion and distrust.
Afraid of falling sick and becoming dependent on others, for this reason
tries to improve his lifestyle.</p>
