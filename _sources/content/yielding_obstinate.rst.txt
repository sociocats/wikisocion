Yielding and obstinate
===============================

**Yielding** / **Obstinate**, sometimes called **Resource-protecting** /
**Interest-protecting**, is one of the 15 `Reinin dichotomies <reinin_dich>`.


Yielding and obstinate types
----------------------------

-  Yielding types are :doc:`SEI <SEI>`, :doc:`ILE <ILE>`, :doc:`IEI <IEI>`, :doc:`SLE <SLE>`, :doc:`ESI <ESI>`, :doc:`LIE <LIE>`, :doc:`EII <EII>`, :doc:`LSE <LSE>`
-  Obstinate types are :doc:`LII <LII>`, :doc:`ESE <ESE>`, :doc:`LSI <LSI>`, :doc:`EIE <EIE>`, :doc:`ILI <ILI>`, :doc:`SEE <SEE>`, :doc:`SLI <SLI>`,    :doc:`IEE <IEE>`
-  Using the :doc:`four-letter code <type_names>`: yielding types are ET or IF, obstinate types are EF or IT.


Theoretical properties of yielding and obstinate types
------------------------------------------------------

Yielding/obstinate corresponds with the
:ref:`evaluatory <evaluatory>`/ :ref:`situational <evaluatory>` dichotomy for
:doc:`rational <ration_irration>` :doc:`information elements <elements>`:

-  The yielding types have evaluatory |symbol_p.gif| |symbol_r.gif| and
   situational |symbol_l.gif| |symbol_e.gif| .
-  The obstinate types have evaluatory |symbol_l.gif| |symbol_e.gif| and
   situational |symbol_p.gif| |symbol_r.gif|.

Typical characteristics
-----------------------

Yielding types
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Resources are 'sacred', but ideas are freely shared and manipulated.
#. Easily aware of the boundaries between their and others' interests.
#. Protect their resources to the point of conflict, and their reaction
   may be unduly strong.
#. If I know I can't do something, I won't and will forget all about
   it.

Obstinate types
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Ideas are 'sacred', but resources are freely shared and manipulated.
#. Easily aware of the boundaries between their and others' resources.
#. Guard their interests from intrusions, and their reaction to such
   intrusions may be quite sharp.
#. I won't abandon my interests just because my resources are
   inadequate, but simply work towards improving my resources until they
   ARE adequate.

Extended characteristics
------------------------

Taken from :doc:`2003 study of Reinin traits <reinin_study>`.

Yielding
~~~~~~~~

-  For the Yielding type, personal resources falls into their "inner
   personal space" (i.e. something that cannot be compromised), which is
   outlined with a "personal boundary", while interests constitute an
   object to be manipulated. Interest is evoked only if it can be
   supported by an adequate, corresponding resource or opportunity.
-  Yielding type, while interacting with other people, freely express
   their interests (they readily share photographs, voice their
   disagreements, consider counterarguments, are ready to share their
   interests with other people and collaborate on them). These types
   clearly delineate interests as "my own" and "those of others".
-  Yielding types protect themselves during conflicts over resources,
   but they do not monitor encroachments on their interests. If anyone
   attempts to claim their resources, thus intruding into their
   "personal space", they react sharply, which can even seem a bit over
   the edge and aggressive. (This reaction is associated with
   "inviolability" of their resources.)

Obstinate
~~~~~~~~~

-  For Obstinate types, their interest fall into their "personal
   ("inviolable") space", which is outlined with a "personal boundary",
   while resources are an object to be manipulated. In the presence of
   an interest, their will seek suitable resources and opportunities.
-  The Obstinate interacting with other people freely operates with
   their resources (they can "share" and "trade" them, purposefully
   replenish them and use them up). They are acutely aware of the
   dividing line between their own resources and those of others.
-  Obstinate types guard themselves from intrusions into their personal
   sphere of interests, while at the same time they pay no heed to
   intrusions on their resources. If someone tries to impose their
   interests on Obstinate types, thus intruding into their personal
   space, their reaction will be sufficiently deterring and sharp (such
   a reaction occurs in cases when other's interests do not become their
   interests).

**Notes**

Key concepts of this dichotomy are "personal space", "resources" (what
we have available at our disposal) and "personal interests" (what is
meant here are not personal interests, but pursuits we find interesting
and feel personal responsibility and attachment to). "Personal space" is
something that an individual feels is an integral part of himself or
herself, cannot renounce it, and will defend it from impositions and
intrusions from outside. For the Yielding types, this space is occupied
by their resources, while for the Obstinate typesby their interests.
Correspondingly, Yielding types manipulate interests (freely change
them, adjust them in accordance with their resources) and
Obstinatetheir resources (they adjust them to their interests).

**Examples**

*Compliant:* "Affairs can be yours and those of other people who can
compel you with their requests" "Interests that cannot be realized
eventually become uninteresting. I let go of old interests easily" "I
try to limit my affairs, how many things I'm involved with, how many
things I am suppose to do. Potentially this is interesting to me but I
will not undertake it" "If I know that I can't do something, I will
reject it and will forget about it" "If I have an interest, it is,
naturally, reflected by capabilities. If something is impossible I won't
go wasting my time and effort on it." "I don't understand people who
list all kinds of interests... personally I clearly know what my
capabilities are"

*Obstinate:* "I never let go of my favorite occupations. I will do them
at expense of sleep, food..." "I certainly won't abandon it.... I'm
inclined to squeeze the situation to the very end" "I can't let go of my
interests out of fear of destruction and loss of my personality" "My
interests are at the limits of my physical capabilities. When my
physical capabilities show me their limitsI back away, but I will do
this only as a very last resort... but even then I will not abandon them
but "postpone" them and await the moment when I have sufficient
resources. I won't let go of my interests, even though the resources are
already insufficient..."
