Delta Quadra
===================

**Delta**, or the 'fourth' :doc:`quadra <quadra>`, includes :doc:`LSE <LSE>`,
:doc:`EII <EII>`, :doc:`IEE <IEE>`, and :doc:`SLI <SLI>`.

:doc:`Reinin <reinin_dich>` caracterises this quadra as Judicious,
Serious, and Aristocratic.


Dominant elements
-----------------

The **dominant**\ :doc:`IM elements <elements>` of the Delta Quadra are
**Te, Fi, Ne, Si** that correspond to symbols |symbol_p.gif|
|symbol_r.gif| |symbol_i.gif| |symbol_s.gif|, respectively. Grouping
together the elements of the :ref:`Ego blocks <ego-block>` of the Delta Quadra
types, we get a picture of what aspects of life Delta Quadra types
strive to bring to the forefront of life, as well as the kind of group
atmosphere and lifestyle they pursue.

**Te** blocked with **Si**: |symbol_p.gif| |symbol_s.gif|

-  Delta types make a point of talking about the rationale behind their
   actions and emphasizing the productiveness or unproductiveness of
   different ways of doing things - even in such emotional areas as
   personal relationships.
-  Delta types value peaceful, refreshing activities where they are
   doing something useful and balancing out their inner world at the
   same time.
-  Delta types have the philosophy that they will have to rely on their
   own industriousness to achieve their goals rather than on luck,
   speculation, group effort, or strong leadership.

**Ne** blocked with **Fi**: |symbol_i.gif| |symbol_r.gif|

-  Delta types love to share personal experience mixed with their own
   sentiments regarding their experiences, but all in an insightful and
   non-dramatic manner.
-  Delta types like to talk about new beginnings, opportunities for
   personal growth, and their plans and prospects for the future.

Subdued elements
----------------

The **subdued**\ :doc:`IM elements <elements>` of the Delta Quadra are
**Fe, Ti, Se, Ni** or |symbol_e.gif| |symbol_l.gif| |symbol_f.gif|
|symbol_t.gif| respectively. Grouping together the elements of the
:ref:`Super-Ego blocks <superego-block>` of the Delta Quadra types, we get a
picture of what aspects of life Delta types strive to keep hidden,
avoid, not focus attention on, and keep at the periphery of their lives.

**Fe** blocked with **Ni**: |symbol_e.gif| |symbol_t.gif|

-  Delta types rarely display their deep passions and vision, preferring
   instead to talk in more neutral terms about what they want to do and
   why.
-  Delta types reject dramatism and emotional affect in favor of wry
   humor and understatement.
-  Delta types don't tend to form or maintain groups based on fun,
   emotional interaction, but only take groups seriously that perform
   some common productive or restful activity.
-  Delta types generally dislike using poetic wording when describing
   their inner state, but talk simply about what they feel or their
   bodily sensations.

**Se** blocked with **Ti**: |symbol_f.gif| |symbol_l.gif|

-  Delta types do not fare well in high-pressure situations where they
   are being forced to do things, are facing threatening opponents, or
   are submitted to rigorous discipline, but wear out quickly and look
   for a more peaceful and welcoming environment.

Group behavior
--------------

Groups made up of primarily Delta types tend to be focused on working on
projects, enjoying physical recreation, or finding out interesting
things about each other. Laughter is usually subdued and brief; instead,
people smile a lot and try to be witty and welcoming. Groups need to be
focused on some specific productive activity or topic of discussion, or
else they fall apart. In Delta groups, there is a lot of splintering and
decentralization. This allows for more focused and productive
interaction with only those who share your particular interests or
sentiments. People jump from small group to small group easily to keep
up their interest level. No one demands that the entire group listen to
one person or that everyone do the same thing. Delta Quadra types
believe that if everyone just pursues their own interests and makes some
accommodations for others, the group will be better off anyway. Delta
Quadra types do not focusing on building group identity or unity of
purpose, but prefer for the group to remain splintered and
decentralized.

Romance styles
--------------

Delta romantic relationships usually begin simply as the encounter of
two individuals interested in a relationship and each other in a
particular moment, with very little in terms of outward demonstrations
of "romance" in the "wooing" sense of the term or in strong external
demonstrations of emotions. Deltas are more focused on the present
moment than Gammas, and therefore even relationships of very strong
attachment do not lead to constant concerns as to their longer-term
practical feasibility. Deltas see as optimal romantic relationships
those where partners spend time together on fun activities and sharing
ideas of potential practical application. Romantic atmospheres are
low-key, based on comfort but practicality.

Perception of other quadras
---------------------------

Alpha
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Deltas tend to see Alpha types as fun company and interesting people to
discuss ideas and prospects with, but naive and inconsistent in their
personal and business relationships. Alpha types seem to lack the common
sense to turn their fun and creative energy into something productive
and often seem overly idealistic.

Beta
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Deltas tend to see Beta types as people who "dream big" and always want
to turn things into grandiose endeavors, yet can't manage day-to-day
affairs effectively. Also, Beta types seem unwilling to consider things
from the point of view of others, which gives them a streak of meanness
and cruelty.

Gamma
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Deltas tend to see Gamma types as driven and reliable in personal and
business relationships, but not sufficiently understanding of people who
want to pursue their own individual path in life. Gamma types sometimes
become too demanding and can have a streak of vindictiveness or
spitefulness which prevents them from being accepting and forgiving.
