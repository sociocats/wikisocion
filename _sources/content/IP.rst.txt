IP temperament
====================

The **IP temperament**, or **receptive-adaptive temperament**, was
identified by :doc:`Viktor Gulenko <gulenko>` and includes the four
:doc:`irrational <ration_irration>` :doc:`introverts <extra_intro>` (one in each
:doc:`quadra <quadra>`): :doc:`IEI <IEI>`, :doc:`SEI <SEI>`, :doc:`ILI <ILI>`, and
:doc:`SLI <SLI>`. Each of these types is also :doc:`dynamic <statics_dynamics>`.


Typical characteristics
-----------------------

-  relaxed
-  go-with-the-flow
-  finds it easy to spend long periods of time in no activity, or at
   very low levels of energy
-  movements are flexible, unhurried
-  little inclination towards fidgetiness when having to remain inactive
   for longer periods

IPs are both dynamic and irrational, so they see reality as in
continuous, gradual, often imperceptible change. An IP is soothed by
this, seeing reality through his :ref:`leading function <leading-func>`. This leads to a relaxed inclination to
take things as they come and adapt to them.

As introverts, IPs tend to be relaxed and somewhat passive about
initiating relationships with other people, mostly assuming that others
will take the initiative.

Perception of other temperaments
--------------------------------

**EP**: IPs see EPs as pleasantly energetic in an unpredictable and
therefore not boring way, also able to take for granted variations in
levels of energy in others.

**EJ**: IPs see EJs as annoyingly pushy and insistent in their
initiatives; they may respect their energy levels but also wonder if
they don't see that a lot of that energy is spent wastefully to no good
purpose.

**IJ**: IPs see IJs as boring and too concerned with stability.
