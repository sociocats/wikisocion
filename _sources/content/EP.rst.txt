EP temperament
=====================

The **EP temperament**, or **flexible-maneuvering temperament**, was
identified by :doc:`Viktor Gulenko <gulenko>` and includes the four
:doc:`irrational <ration_irration>` :doc:`extroverts <extra_intro>` (one in each
:doc:`quadra <quadra>`): :doc:`ILE <ILE>`, :doc:`SLE <SLE>`, :doc:`SEE <SEE>`, and
:doc:`IEE <IEE>`. Each of these types is also :doc:`static <statics_dynamics>`.


Typical characteristics
-----------------------

-  flexible
-  mobile
-  impulsive, shifting from apparent inactivity to bursts of energy,
   often several times a day, showing impatience during them
-  walk is energetic but "cat-like"
-  often seems optimistic and open-minded
-  entertains people easily and naturally
-  inclined to fidget when forced to remain inactive for long periods

EPs are both static and irrational, so they perceive reality as mostly
not changing, and when it does, it's in abrupt "leaps" from one state to
another. An EP is bothered by the lack of change, especially as seen
through his :ref:`leading function <leading-func>`, since his personal
preference is for change. That makes him impulsive, with sudden bursts
of action, energy, or even just thought, as he tries to get his
perceptions "moving".

As extroverts, EPs tend to be feel that it is up to them to initiate
contacts with other people, and EPs in particular tend to feel quite
natural in that role.

Perception of other temperaments
--------------------------------

**Exxj**: Eps perceive Ejs as active but too restless and nervous,
slightly annoying due to a lack of sense of spontaneity.

**Ixxp**: Eps perceive Ips as pleasantly flexible and responsive to
their initiatives, sometimes too unpredictable but for that very reason
never boring.

**Ixxj**: Eps perceive Ijs as too predictable and boring, too unwilling
to do things on the spur of the moment.
