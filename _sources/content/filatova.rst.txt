Ekaterina Filatova
====================================

**Ekaterina Filatova** (April 2nd, 1938  March 14th, 2015) was one of
the early Russian socionists from St. Petersburg, Russia who helped to
popularize socionics. She was known for publication of several socionics
books, as well as her collection of photographs of people of different
sociotypes. It should be noted that Ekaterina Filatova did not herself
use :doc:`visual identification ("V.I.") <vi>` to
diagnose the types of the people in her books. Upon taking pictures and
documenting types, she started to notice some similarities between
people of the same type and has commented that within each type there
are several groupings of people who look most similar, which could be
due to subtypes. Some western readers have interpreted this to mean that
she was promoting V.I, which is not correct. Ekaterina Filatova
self-typed as TIM :doc:`EII <EII>`.

Biography
---------

Ekaterina Filatova obtained her education as a physicist, graduating
from the Physics Department of LGU as a candidate of physical and
mathematical sciences. She then worked in Novosibirsk Institute. In
1996, she moved to St. Petersburg.

Filatova is the author of one of the most popular books in socionics by
both the number of copies sold and by popularity among the readers. This
book was written in simple and accessible language and is one of the
most easily accessible introductions to the basics of Socionics, which
prompted a lot of positive feedback from her readers. When it comes to
creation of new socionics theories, she has not made any significant
contributions. (Being of type EII, competing with ILEs in creation of
new models and complex theoretical approaches to socionics was rather
difficult.) Instead, Filatova has compiled and recounted the ideas of
other socionics, and by this she has become one of the best and most
successful popularizers of socionics.

Filatova was also the first the start taking and collecting photographs
of people that she has previously typed. She has built this collection
of photographs since 1991: first typing people and then saving their
picture. Eventually she started noticing similarities in their external
appearance that were too frequent to be only incidental, and an
unusually frequent number of "twins" within the same type - people who
looked very similarly. Further treatment and development of this
observation were conducted in works of Ruslan Stepanov and Timofei
Duhovskiy.

In 2011, Filatova was awarded the title of doctor of philosophy in
subject of socionics by the International Council of Socionics Research
and Development.
