Extraversion and introversion
=================================

**Extraversion** / **Introversion** is one of the 4 :doc:`Jungian dichotomies <jungian>`, and one of the 15 :doc:`Reinin dichotomies <reinin_dich>`.

Introduction
------------

Extraversion as a socionic trait is defined by the :ref:`leading function <leading-func>` of a type. If the leading function is
extraverted, the type is called "extraverted" or "extratim"; conversely
if the leading function of type is introverted, then this type is called
"introverted" or "introtim". It should be kept in mind that the
:doc:`model <model_a>` of every type has both extraverted and introverted
elements. Depending on which element is involved, a person may appear to
be more "extraverted" or more "introverted" in that moment.

In socionics, "extraversion" is a perceptual quality defined by a focus
on the characteristics and behavior of objects (people, things, events)
outside the observer. In contrast, "introversion" means a focus on the
observer's response to and perception of objects.

| **Extraverts:** qualities of objects are taken for granted, while
  interrelationships between objects are seen as being malleable; change
  interaction of objects to better fit qualities of objects.
| **Introverts:** interrelationships are taken for granted, while
  qualities of object are seen as being malleable; adapt qualities of
  objects to better fit their interrelationships.

:doc:`Augusta <augusta>` likened the difference between extraverted and
introverted perception to the difference between :doc:`bodies <bodies_fields>` and
:doc:`fields <bodies_fields>` in physics. "Bodies" are objects with mass and
certain qualities, while "fields" are the realm of interaction between
bodies.

Carl Jung believed that introversion and extraversion were present in
everyone, but that one attitude-type is invariably dominant. He
described the extravert as trusting what is received from the outside
world while regarding implicit factors and motivations of secondary
importance, while the introvert may be well aware of external
conditions, but he is not motivated by them, rather he responds
primarily to his internal impressions of the external events. See :doc:`the extraverted type <psychological_types>`, :doc:`the introverted type <psychological_types>`, and
`extraversion and introversion <http://www.the16types.info/vbulletin/content.php/190-Introduction-to-Jung-Lexicon>`_.

In socionics, :doc:`IM elements <elements>`, :doc:`information aspects <information_aspect>`, and types can all be treated as
extraverted or introverted.

Extraverted and introverted types
---------------------------------

-  Extraverted :doc:`IM types <socionic_type>` are: :doc:`ILE <ILE>`, :doc:`ESE <ESE>`, :doc:`EIE <EIE>`, :doc:`SLE <SLE>`, :doc:`SEE <SEE>`, :doc:`LIE <LIE>`, :doc:`LSE <LSE>`, and :doc:`IEE <IEE>`.
-  Introverted :doc:`IM types <socionic_type>` are: :doc:`SEI <SEI>`, :doc:`LII <LII>`, :doc:`LSI <LSI>`, :doc:`IEI <IEI>`, :doc:`ILI <ILI>`, :doc:`ESI <ESI>`, :doc:`EII <EII>`, and :doc:`SLI <SLI>`.
-  Using the :doc:`four-letter code <type_names>`: Extraverted types have an *E*, introverted types have an *I* as first letter.


Typical characteristics
-----------------------


Extraverted types
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Psychic energy more often flows outwards.
#. Energy level increases when interacting with a large group of people.
#. Energy level decreases when they are alone.
#. Energy level is generally higher.
#. More often focused on their surroundings.
#. Tend to be more active and initiating.
#. Often make new friends easily.
#. Often better at presenting themselves.
#. Often prefer to work in a team.

Introverted types
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Psychic energy more often flows inwards.
#. Energy level increases when they are alone.
#. Energy level decreases when interacting with a large group of people.
#. Energy level is generally lower.
#. More often focused on their thoughts and feelings.
#. Tend to be more passive, less initiating.
#. Often do not have many friends.
#. Often better at concentrating.
#. Often prefer to work alone.

Note on sociability and extraversion/introversion
-------------------------------------------------

A common misconception, also compounded by some interpretations of
:doc:`MBTI <MBTI>` or even of :doc:`Jung's typology <jung_typology>`, is
that extratims are extraverted as in "socially outgoing", and intratims
are introverted as in "socially reserved". In socionics terms, however,
that is not the case. An introtim may be socially outgoing and even
prefer a situation with broad and intensive social interaction as in a
large group; an extratim may be socially reserved in terms of preferring
social interactions limited to a very small number of select
individuals. What is more important, in terms of socionics
extraversion/introversion, is whether the individual is inclined to take
the initiative in establishing the social interaction (of whatever
kind), or prefers to let others take this initiative.
