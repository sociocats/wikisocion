Temperament
===============

Attempts have been made to describe the socionic types in terms of
temperament. First, some socionists after :doc:`Augusta <augusta>`
correlated the four classical temperaments (melancholic, choleric,
sanguine, and phlegmatic) with types, however, these attempts have not
been widely accepted. The most well-known temperament system was
introduced by :doc:`Viktor Gulenko <gulenko>` and puts the 16 types
into four groups that share the same two traits of the
:doc:`extroversion <extra_intro>` / :doc:`introversion <extra_intro>` and
:doc:`irrational <ration_irration>` / :doc:`rational <ration_irration>` dichotomies. The
same four :doc:`intertype relations <intertype>` exist between
the types of any temperament: :doc:`identity <identity>`,
:doc:`business <business>`, :doc:`super-ego <superego>`, and
:doc:`kindred <kindred>`. In Russian the temperament names consist of two
adjectives that describe common characteristics of these types, while in
English a different notation has been used:

-  :doc:`EP temperament <EP>` (Flexible-maneuvering)
-  :doc:`EJ temperament <EJ>` (Linear-assertive)
-  :doc:`IP temperament <IP>` (Receptive-adaptive)
-  :doc:`IJ temperament <IJ>` (Balanced-stable)

It should be noted that temperament in socionics has taken on a
different meaning than in psychology. Compared to vague and abstract
socionic concepts of temperament, temperament in psychology is defined
more exactly, allowing for better empirical study.

Nevertheless, socionic temperaments can play an important role in
recognizing similarities between types that are all in different
:doc:`quadras <quadra>` and :doc:`clubs <club>`.
