Club of researchers
=========================

**Club of researchers** includes :doc:`ILE <ILE>`, :doc:`LII <LII>`,
:doc:`LIE <LIE>`, and :doc:`ILI <ILI>`.


Typical characteristics of researchers
--------------------------------------

**Researchers** are natural theorists.

Heavy researchers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Heavy researchers** are :doc:`ILE <ILE>` and :doc:`LII <LII>`. They are a
mirror pair of :doc:`Alpha <alpha_quadra>`.


Light researchers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Light researchers** are :doc:`LIE <LIE>` and :doc:`ILI <ILI>`. They are a
mirror pair of :doc:`Gamma <gamma_quadra>`.

Group behavior
--------------

When a group consists of people of this club, but without either of the
two quadras having greater presence, its members tend to limit their
interactions to the exchange of ideas in their common areas of
interests, with little focus on the interchange of personal experiences
regarding relationships, or physical activities besides perhaps walks
with ongoing discussions. Typical examples of this club are enthusiasts
of science fiction, role-play games, groups of political discussions,
and the like.

This kind of group behavior, though, in terms of seeing a club as any
kind of unit, is visible only as long as the group is held together by,
and focuses on, discussions and activities of their common interests.
Longer and deeper interactions make such a club visibly "split" into the
two quadras, Alpha and Gamma.

Perception of other clubs
-------------------------

These perceptions are visible only as long as the other groups are seen
exclusively through the prism of their activities and interests as a
group; closer interaction makes such perceptions quickly be overruled by
the relevant quadra perceptions.

Socials
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Researchers are inclined to perceive Socials as essentially empty-headed
and boring in their interests, but also to regard them with some
jealousy due to their usual greater facility for social interaction and
forming relationships, also romantic ones.

Pragmatists
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Researchers are inclined to perceive Pragmatists as narrow-minded and
somewhat uninteresting, but also as intimidating due to their perceived
greater mechanical and physical skills.

Humanitarians
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Researchers are inclined to see Humanitarians sympathetically and as
essentially non-threatening, but also with a sense of bewilderment as to
their motivations.
