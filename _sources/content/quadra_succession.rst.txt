Quadra succession
====================

.. warning::
    This page or section is **incomplete**. Additional contributions are needed. 

The theory of quadra succession was suggested by Kiev socionists in the late 1980s (needs to be confirmed). According to this concept, which has not been clearly elucidated in writing, the evolution of large groups — and especially the organization and leadership style of the group — tends to follow from quadra to quadra over time, with each quadra "preparing the way" for the advent of the next. According to this idea, people who belong to different quadras tend to play a prominent, decisive role in group development at different stages of its development.
