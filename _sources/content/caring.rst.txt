Caring
=============

The **Caring** types, identified as such by :doc:`Viktor Gulenko <gulenko>`, are the four types with **Si** |symbol_s.gif| **in their
ego block**, two types in :doc:`Alpha quadra <alpha_quadra>` and two types in
:doc:`Delta Quadra <delta_quadra>`: :doc:`ESE <ESE>`, :doc:`SEI <SEI>`, :doc:`LSE <LSE>`,
and :doc:`SLI <SLI>`.

Despite the differences between these types in terms of
:doc:`temperament <temperament>`, :ref:`base function <leading-func>`, and
:doc:`quadra <quadra>` `values <quadra>`, it seems that in the area of
physical attraction, desire, and flirting, the :ref:`ego <ego-block>`
:doc:`element <elements>` Si |symbol_s.gif| is the most significant factor
in determining Caring type's behavior.


Typical Characteristics of "Caring" Romancing Style
---------------------------------------------------

-  Inclination towards smooth, easy flowing, "soft" or suave interaction
   with elements of playful teasing, rather than "hard" approach and
   direct physical provocation.
-  Attraction is sparked by aesthetic and mental attributes of the
   prospective partner, but cools if such attributes are accompanied by
   an overly "aggressive" sexuality.
-  Caring types are attentive in courtship. In conversation, they are
   inclined to focus their attention on the statements and needs of
   their partner, and may ask questions concerning how their partner is
   doing and how are they feeling.
-  Interest is kept up if their partner is welcoming of their care and
   attention, and even evokes it, and seeks them out.
-  Prone to assume that partner needs their support and help in everyday
   daily matters, and in meeting their needs.
-  Neutral as to who ended a relationship. "Power" is not seen as
   important in such matters, though the ethical matters may still be of
   importance.

This romance style is defined by focus on Si |symbol_s.gif| which is
dynamic, irrational, and introverted, with perceptions of the present
reality and physical sensations rather than inner imagery. This means
that a Caring type sees attraction between two individuals as a dynamic
state, which he feels is completely natural, as he also sees the
physical comfort and well-being of another person as dynamic. This
accounts for a Caring type's inclination to focus on the mutual
attraction, or particularly the attraction felt by the other person, as
connected to that person's physical well-being. The individual's own
dynamic and introverted Ne |symbol_s.gif| perceptions lead to a sense of
sleepy drifting in them, which makes him welcome |symbol_i.gif| impulses
from another person designed to shake him out of it from time to time.

Perception of other romance styles
----------------------------------

This refers to perceptions of the partner in a romantic or prospective
relationship.

:doc:`Aggressor <aggressor>`\ **:** Caring types tend to perceive
Aggressors as a bit over-the-top in their approach to romantic
interactions and sexuality and ultimately not pleasant to have stable
intimate relationships with.

:doc:`Victim <victim>`\ **:** Caring types tend to perceive Victims as
puzzling and never contented, sometimes as paranoid and insecure.

:doc:`Caring <caring>`\ **:** Caring types tend to perceive other Caring
types as comfortable partners, but ultimately somehow less than
satisfactory, having excessive focus on their needs while not clearly
demonstrating their own.

:doc:`Childlike <childlike>`\ **:** Caring types tend to perceive Childlike
types as fun, interesting, and delightful partners, who make refreshing,
unusual, and sometimes very clever comments, that bring a sense of joy
to their lives.


Description from :doc:`Life Scenarios <life_scenarios>` by V. Gulenko
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**"Caring"** man (LSE, SLI, SEI, ESE). Experienced, attentive to the
inner world of a woman partner, who can positively predispose towards
himself with protective courtship. In love games he very much
appreciates feminine tenderness and vulnerability, and waits admiration
of his life experiences and skills.

**"Caring"** woman (LSE, SLI, SEI, ESE). Inclined to care for her male
partner. She is attracted to weak but intelligent men who accept her
lead in daily activities. She likes to support, to protect, to cheer
them up. These character traits that in the public opinion don't evoke
respect for men, this woman forgives or finds them perfectly acceptable.

"Caring" woman is rejecting of intense, but rough caresses. Erotic games
that are deprived of foreplay and based on force oppress her sexuality,
thus relations with strong forceful men are often disappointing to her.
The behavior of compatible man must be "child-like" i.e. reluctant,
waiting-enticing. This woman loves caresses that are expressed as
gentle, subtle touches of her erogenous zones. Relationship with a
"Victim" man is not satisfactory to her either, because his caprices,
tricks, and provocations of force from her surprise and repel her.
Relations with similar to her "Caring" man after some time start to
disappoint her, although she doesn't have much against such a
relationship. Sooner or later, she feels a lack of spiritual connection
in them.
