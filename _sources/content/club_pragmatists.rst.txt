Club of pragmatists
==============================

**Club of pragmatists** includes :doc:`SLE <SLE>`, :doc:`LSI <LSI>`,
:doc:`LSE <LSE>`, and :doc:`SLI <SLI>`.


Typical characteristics of pragmatists
--------------------------------------


Heavy pragmatists
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Heavy pragmatists** are :doc:`SLE <SLE>` and :doc:`LSI <LSI>`. They are a
mirror pair of :doc:`Beta <beta_quadra>`.



Light pragmatists
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Light pragmatists** are :doc:`LSE <LSE>` and :doc:`SLI <SLI>`. They are a
mirror pair of :doc:`Delta <delta_quadra>`.


Group behavior
--------------

When a group consists of members of this club, but without either of the
two quadras having greater weight, its interactions are likely to be
based on sports activities or discussion of, or cooperation in, projects
related to manual work and engineering. Very typical examples of groups
formed mainly of members of this club are groups of car enthusiasts
where actively repairing and refurbishing them with their own hands is a
key component of their activities.

This kind of group behavior, though, in terms of seeing a club as any
kind of unit, is visible only as long as the group is held together by,
and focuses on, discussions and activities of their common interests.
Longer and deeper interactions make such a club visibly "split" into the
two quadras, Beta and Delta.


Perception of other clubs
-------------------------

These perceptions are visible only as long as the other groups are seen
exclusively through the prism of their activities and interests as a
group; closer interaction makes such perceptions quickly be overruled by
the relevant quadra perceptions.

Researchers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Pragmatists are inclined to regard Researchers with a mix of contempt
and respectful wariness: they see Researchers as useless in anything
involving "real work" or facing "the real world" but are often baffled
when Researchers demonstrate insight and knowledge.

Socials
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Pragmatists are inclined to perceive Socials as fun company but a bit
lightweight.

Humanitarians
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Pragmatists are inclined to see Humanitarians as either totally puzzling
in their ideas and beliefs or intimidatingly worthy of admiration for
the same reason.
