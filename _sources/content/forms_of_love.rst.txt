*We are given enjoyment not by what surrounds up, but by our attitude towards it.* - La Rochefoucauld

Introduction
------------

Love - is an individual creative work of human beings, thus it can be
said that however many people there are, there are as many kinds of
love. Yet, even in this most most mysterious and unfathomable field,
there are some laws and patterns that allow us to distinguish 8 basic
types of love.

Of course, the forms of expression of feelings - are not yet love, but
only the inclination towards one or another kind of it. Love - is a
multifaceted feeling that can be expressed in different ways. For it are
inherent: passion and tenderness, bliss and quiet tranquility, delight
and anger, joy and anxiety, fear and even anger. Nonetheless, no matter
how many colors and shapes may be in love, it is always striving for
understanding, spiritual closeness, common occupations.

Love - it's intimate and profound feeling, with the desire for
commitment and constancy. It is characterized by the perception of the
other person as a unique and inimitable personality, his idealization.

This idealization not only dazzles loving, but, on the contrary, making
it "seeing" as it allows to see what others do not see in your favorite.
This feeling is not controlled by any mind or will, it can not be forced
to trigger or suppress. Love gives rise to the desire to reciprocity,
therefore stimulates a person to self-improvement and development of
their best qualities, making it more meaningful, more interesting.

Loving people often mentally seeks advice to the object of his senses,
evaluates himself, his thoughts and acts as if his position. This causes
the effect of the presence of a loved one, even if it is far away; focus
on his assessment, outlook, perception. With a harmonious blend of
reciprocity of feelings intensified over the years, with disharmonious -
multiply misunderstandings. In such cases, people are trying in vain to
explain the collapse of their illusions flimsy reasons, not realizing
that the reason is the same: love, they spoke different languages ??and
could not adapt to each other. Knowing the nature of their feelings, it
can be avoided.

Complete harmony, as well as complete happiness - are extremely rare,
but the path to it, though not easy, is only through the knowledge of
the characteristics of each other. And still - through a desire to turn
his attraction to a person in true love. And for this it is necessary to
understand the nature of love and the different forms of its
manifestation.

Not all relations can be called love, but the species can occur in any
situation, whether it is friendship or partnership, a passing
acquaintance or a long-standing desire.

For example, people who are inclined more to the sensual love, have at
its core the type of relationship - eros. This means that testing is not
attracted to each partner, people with this type of relationship over
the spiritual and intellectual proximity appreciate specific sensations,
carrying them joy in communicating with partners: delicious food, touch,
gifts, entertainment and other joint earthly pleasures. Vividly their
hedonism manifested in love; less pronounced in friendly and business
relations. In the case of aversion to the partner, a person with this
form of the senses produces the sharpest criticism often on aspects
related to feelings.

The forms of love are associated with certain features of character, on
the basis of which was created by the author's typology of accents of
the characters with their corresponding forms of feelings and
relationships (character accents - complexes of certain character traits
associated with the projection of the elements of information exchange,
manifested in the psycho-physical level of personality).

To determine the nature of their accents, and then - the form of
feelings and relationships, we proceed to testing, which will be simple
and concise.

Test for Accentuations of Personality
-------------------------------------

The test consists of an 8-scales with a set of relevant statements. Each
of these scales has its own drive letter and corresponds to a particular
accent character. To determine what the nature of accents you most
pronounced, read all of the text, noting in each scale number of
statements with which you agree, estimating the number of replies to the
pros, the relevant degree of your confidence in the correctness of the
chosen statement:

| (+) - Yes, it happens quite often (most likely agree);
| (++) - Yes, it happens almost always (agree);
| (+++) - Yes, it happens always (totally agree).
| Compare the results. In what scale advantages will be more - this is the main focus will be your character. Write down the letter abbreviation of the scale, which is best for you. Choose from the remaining 7-scales and the one that more than any other reflects your features and also make a note of its number.

Look, what of the remaining scales you could put on the third place.
Write her a letter. Perhaps this is not found, then you have only two
accent character. First, you select the main focus will be the following
- optional. Read their names that match the letters you have chosen the
Latin scales and discover the characteristics suggested below.

Note: If the predominantly positive statements you have selected two
test scale and accents your chosen correspond to the two leading
features of your type - congratulations: you are quite whole person, and
you have little internal contradictions. If you select two or more
scales and do not know which one to prefer, try to determine their main
focus character by choosing the most suitable characteristics (of the
alleged resulting from testing). Read the descriptions of his alleged
type accent and make his self-portrait, consisting of two or three

Characteristics of Forms of Love
--------------------------------

1. **Storge** - this is love-tenderness, that includes deep
understanding and compassion. The ability to compromise, kindness, and
ability to smooth out the contradictions are all inherent to such
feeling. This form of relations is characterized by: solidarity with a
partner in everything, leniency towards their shortcomings, pursuit of a
harmonious, stable, pleasant, and laid-back attitude. This is an ideal
form of love for family life, provided that the partner will show some
sensitivity. Excessive vulnerability of this feeling does not make it
resilient in all cases. The attraction of the soul is of main
significance here, prevailing over physical attraction. Storge
originated in antiquity, developed further during the Renaissance, and
in our time has not lost its relevance.

2. **Mania** - prolonged emotional ecstasy, obsession with love,
over-valuation of its significance, which leads to strong emotional
shocks, reckless actions, and even dramas. This feeling is strong,
possessive, demanding, thirsty for complete reciprocity, but also
capable of many compromises. This love is very enduring, even in those
cases when it is unrequited. Often it is capable of heroism and
sacrifice, and even unconditional devotion. It is full of
contradictions, since it is very dependent on changeable moods. Quarrels
may be frequent with this kind of love, as well as sharp contrasts in
behavior, even fleeting infidelity. It is the cause for unpredictable
actions and disregard for generally accepted norms of behavior. Mania
love exists since ancient times, but it became most widespread in the
20th century in Western Europe after the sexual revolution, whose
followers called for the emancipation of the senses and the denial of
the cold bourgeois rationality. It has not lost its relevance in our
pragmatic time, though it has become less dramatic.

3. **Analita** - a form of love for which the wish for calm and rational
relations is inherent. This love is individual-selective, with high
demands towards the object of feelings, with a tendency to become
disappointed in that person, if he or she did not meet some
expectations. This demanding attitude is devoid of idealism, but often
exceeds the real abilities of people. This feeling is intellectual, with
a tendency to think and analyze the behavior of the partner, while not
immersing in his inner world. It has an abstracting-generalizing nature,
with tendencies to draw conclusions detached from the object of
feelings; here, are a few emotions and sensations. Not marked by
propensity to yield and make concessions. Aspiring to a reasonable and
harmonious combination of intellectual needs and physical desires, the
owner of Analita form of love requires many concessions from his or her
partner. This form of love most clearly manifested in the 19th century
and is well reflected in the philosophy of Freud, Nietzsche,
Schopenhauer, and others. In many, who do not meet their ideal partner,
this form of love is transformed into its complete negation. In current
times of progressing equality of genders (biarhata) it gradually loses
its relevance and manifests less vividly, but it is still relevant.
Since no name was given to it in literature, the author has proposed her
own term.

4. **Pragma** - sober, pragmatic, and sensible form of love according to
a spiritual or material calculation. Despite certain ego-centrism, it is
oriented at a fair balance between "giving" and "receiving". It presumes
relating to the object of one's feelings with respect and with a wish to
understand them. This form of love is natural and rational in the
manifestation of its needs. It is characterized by an aspiration towards
mutual satisfaction of desires and interests, although personal
interests in it sometimes put above the interests of the partner. Habit
strengthens it, and over time the object of feelings turns into a
necessary possession, which is treated with much care. This form of love
was described by Spinoza. It was most popular was in the 18th century,
although it existed in all historical periods. It has not lost its
popularity in our time. Unions that are associated with it are called
marriages of convenience.

5. **Agape** - this is sacrificial and idealistic form of love. It is
based on tolerance at its foundation. This is a pretty stable feeling
with elements of fatalism. Its owner is able to forgive much and take
self-denial as granted. Refined and poetic, such love can exist for a
long time at a distance from the object of feelings, even without hope
for reciprocity. Within it lies the desire to protect one's illusion
from any destructive actions from reality, thus in such relations there
is a tendency for self-deception. Despite its complex and contradictory
nature, it, more than other forms of love, predisposes to humility.
Sometimes a person who has this form of love has to take radical
decisions, for example, to part with a loved one out of their own
initiative. But the image of a loved one, even after a long time of
separation, can be observed loyalty. Spiritual desire here always
prevails over the physical. This form of love-humility became more
wide-spread with the emergence of Christianity, but it is still relevant
in our time.

6. **Filia** - this is a spiritual feeling, which is based on kinship of
souls, interests, and motives at its foundation - a kind of intellectual
communion. This feeling engenders friendship with sense of deep respect
and understanding. It has a very selective character, uniting
like-minded people and stimulating mutual development of capabilities.
This is a love between equal partners, that does not tolerate coercion
and, moreover, dictates in anything. People who are characterized by
this form of love can remain loyal only to a chosen partner who does not
disappoint them. They part without regrets with partners who did not
meet their expectations, or who are alien to them in spirit and ways of
thinking. They are much more tolerant of sexual disharmony. This form of
love was developed in the Renaissance, but was glorified even before
those times by Plato, and since then called platonic. Nowadays, it is
becoming increasingly important for groups and societies too saturated
by sexual permissiveness.

7. **Eros** - this is a passionate, powerful, and sensual attraction to
the object of love. Appearance and manner of behavior of a loved one are
of great value here. They evoke aesthetic feelings and reverence before
the outward perfection, often exaggerated - of face, figure, gait.
People for whom this form of love is predominant seek harmony of both
body and soul, and are able to turn a blind eye to minor flaws and
faults. Inspired by love, they are capable of great devotion, constantly
improving their own manners and ways of expressing their feelings, as
well as forms of their body, beauty of their clothes, aesthetics of
their environment. They willingly adjust and adapt their partner to
themselves. They give much importance to physical enjoyments. Not
finding the desired harmony, they become forever disappointed in the
object of their feelings, and easily part ways with him or her. This
form of displays of affection became widespread in ancient Greece, is
most characteristic of developed societies, and is still widely promoted
by the media and various forms of art.

8. **Victoria** - this type of erotic behavior is the most distant from
the intellectual and spiritual needs than others. It lacks in depth and
creativity. It is based on a pleasant feeling of conquering the object
of one's feelings. This is a kind of game-struggle. If the conquered
person does not resist, interest towards him or her is quickly lost. For
introverts or ambiverts (less sociable people) this feeling can be very
stable and reliable, when a loved one is regarded as a necessary
possession. Attention to the partner manifests as never-ending demands,
which imply the best of intentions. This feeling can be quite
ego-centric, sometimes distant from compassion. In extroverts (more
outgoing people) this form of love often lacks consistency, since the
pursuit of sexual diversity that gives a sense of the joy of new
victories is inherent to it. The partner is often seen as an enemy or as
a fortress, that is taken by storm. The partner is looked down upon,
without mercy, and without any desire to achieve full mutual
understanding. This form of love originated in ancient Greece. It was
most popular during the times of slavery. Currently, in more developed
and spiritual societies, it loses its popularity. In American culture,
after the sexual revolution, the extroverted form of this love has
gained popularity, and has not lost its relevance to the moment. In an
archaic form, the introverted form of this type of love persists in
societies that traditionally assign women a secondary role.

Compatibility of Forms of Love
------------------------------

Human life is rarely complete without love, but everyone loves in his
own way. We need to understand the main thing - a person can not love as
you want it. He likes the way he is by nature tend to. Your right to
take his love for what it is, or reject it, if this form of expression
of feelings you do not like. If you want to achieve harmony in the
feelings with someone you love, understand what forms of relationship,
each unconsciously expects from the other, and try to develop them in
yourself. They say that a habit - this is second nature, so desirable
over time, can become a reality. Consider the compatibility relations on
a purely personal, emotional level.

**The most compatible combinations:**

1. Storge and Pragma.  : The union of Peacemaker and Professional.
2. Mania and Analita.  : The union of Romantic and Logician.
3. Agape and Victoria.  : The union of Forecaster and Conqueror.
4. Filia and Eros.  : The union of Dreamer and Epicurean.

These opposite kinds of love are highly complementary. For example, a
very strong union forms between people with forms of love Storge and
Pragma, as with these feelings calm harmonious life that strengthens
relations is very much valued. Mania can significantly move its bearer,
who wants to meet the particularly high requirements of Analita
personality, who, in turn, balances with sober rationality impulsive
feelings of Mania. With the commanding proprietary Victoria only a
sacrificial feeling Agape can get along, capable of obeying the will of
another. As for the love form Eros, then only extensive capabilities and
imagination of intellectual Filia can retain for a long time the
interest of such a passionate and demanding partner. This is an
excellent union of mind, body, and soul.

**Incompatible types of relationships include:**

1. Storge and Analita.  : Gentle, vulnerable Storge cannot stand aloof and spiritless, strict  and demanding Analita. For Analita Storge is too primitive, boring,  and even saccharine. It is hard for them to find mutual understanding  and harmony in feelings.
2. Mania and Pragma.  : The cult of the emotions is not compatible with practical  calculation. Mania to Pragma seems restless and clingy, Pragma to  Mania - cynical and boring.
3. Agape and Eros.  : Melancholic Agape does not evoke admiration and excitement in Eros.  Eros wounds Agape by its high demands. In addition, the owner of Eros  does not need sympathy, pity, and humility, but rather an equal  partner, who evokes elation of feelings.
4. Filia and Victoria.  : It's the age-old conflict between the spiritual and the corporeal,  between the desire for equality and subordination, between practical  interests and their neglect. They are not attracted to each other.

**Combinations of types of relations with an average compatibility
(which with some fine-tuning can get along):**

1. Storge and Victoria.  : Tactful Storge goes for compromises for the sake of harmony and  durability of relations. She is patient and with time softens  Victoria. Its ability to be flexible at times brings it closer to  Agape, that is necessary for Victoria.
2. Mania and Eros.  : The cult of love unites them and in the beginning makes their  emotions bright. Over time, fatigue sets in from satiation with  emotions, but Mania firmly holds onto Eros. Their relationship is  usually turbulent, but interesting for both. However, the exact  outcome here is not always predictable.
3. Agape and Pragma.  : Idealistic sacrificial attitude and sound calculation, despite some  friction, converge on the mutual desire for stability and permanence.
4. Filia and Analita.  : This is a highly intellectual union in which both strive for  perfection. However, for Filia there is not enough sensuality, and  for Analita - emotionality in their relationship, but they find  common interests that bring them together. They will part with each  other only because of ideological differences or intimate  dissatisfaction.

Partner can't always adapt to each other with an average degree of
compatibility, but if it happens, they manage to get along.

There is another combination of forms of love with an average degree of
compatibility, when the partners mutually cancel/extinguish each other's
feelings. In such cases, there is either no convergence, or people
quickly lose interest in each other and part. However, in some cases,
people in such couples adapt to each other under the pressure of
external factors: children, property issues, etc. But they strongly
irritate each other, which is difficult to endure if there is no love.

**Extinguishing relations:**

1. Storge and Mania.  : Tenderness and passion with shared focus on the cult of love at  first makes them very attractive partners for each other. But soon it  turns out that they understand love differently, and this is  disappointing to both.
2. Agape and Filia.  : Sacrificial attitude and equality together in love are mutually  exclusive. Problems in demonstrations of emotions and sexual  initiatives can extinguish both of them. Their interests are  spiritual, but different. They get bored with each other, although  superficial friendship relations can be maintained for a long time.
3. Analita and Pragma.  : Due to shared sober approach to love they first become interested  in each other, come together based on mutual respect, but it's rather  cold for them with each other. The emotional side of love is not  expressed in this union. In addition, Pragma does not seek to become  the way Analita wants to see it. As a result, mutual disappointment  arrives.
4. Eros and Victoria.  : In the beginning this union may be turbulent. But Eros, that  strives for harmony in feelings and does not accept suppression of  personality, becomes disappointed in Victoria, and she, in turn, does  not try to keep him. They are both very independent and easily go  separate ways.

The problem of relations between people is complex and multifaceted. Of
course, approaches, that are based on understanding of relations on
emotional and sexual levels, do not completely solve the whole problem
of relationships, but they open up the curtain for understanding of this
aspect of relationships. For more complete understanding of problems of
personal relationships, we propose to take another step into this
innermost region.

Correspondence of Forms of Relations and Emotions

Exploring forms of relationships, we noticed that there was some
relationship between them and the forms of emotion, described Russian
psychologist BI Dodonov. Having established these relationships, we have
a new classification of the forms of feelings and relationships If you

be able to bring him joy or achieve emotional harmony, you will be
interested to know what emotions bring the largest and most significant
satisfaction with the representatives of the various accents of nature
with forms of relationships inherent in them.

Typically, each person dominates the type of emotion that matches the
leading accent character. This does not mean that emotions do not fall
into the category of leading, do not deliver a man pleasure, or not
tested at all. Just the most typical type of emotions a person
experiences more and c greatest pleasure.

Introduction to the classification of emotions will help you to
understand why the other person, which is next to you, does not feel the
same joy as you do on those or other external emotional stimuli. Do not
accuse him of callousness or enthusiasm, or - even worse, indifference
only because he differently arranged.

Knowing the shape of human emotions you are interested, you can learn a
lot in him, in his reactions or expectations. This is another way to
compare your feelings and desires with the feelings of others and search
for a compromise that satisfies both sides fullest. In other words -
this is another step towards each other in the difficult and thorny path
of understanding.
