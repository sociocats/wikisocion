Typical characteristics of humanitarians

Heavy humanitarians

mirror pair of :doc:`Delta <delta_quadra>`.


Light humanitarians
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Light humanitarians** are :doc:`EIE <EIE>` and :doc:`IEI <IEI>`. They are a
mirror pair of :doc:`Beta <beta_quadra>`.


Group behavior
--------------

When a group consists of members of this club, but without either of the
two quadras having greater weight, its interactions are likely to be
formed around common spiritual, philosophical, artistic, literary or
humanitarian interests. Very typical and common examples of such clubs
are religious discussion groups, humanitarian and charity organizations
such as NGOs, groups of literary and musical activities.

This kind of group behavior, though, in terms of seeing a club as any
kind of unit, is visible only as long as the group is held together by,
and focuses on, discussions and activities of their common interests.
Longer and deeper interactions make such a club visibly "split" into the
two quadras, Beta and Delta.


Perception of other clubs
-------------------------

These perceptions are visible only as long as the other groups are seen
exclusively through the prism of their activities and interests as a
group; closer interaction makes such perceptions quickly be overruled by
the relevant quadra perceptions.

Researchers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Humanitarians are inclined to regard Researchers with sympathy and
admiration for their intellectual pursuits but with some puzzlement at
their apparent "lack of interest in people".

Socials
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Humanitarians are inclined to perceive Socials as pleasant company but a
bit too shallow in their interests and pursuits.

Pragmatists
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Humanitarians are inclined to see Pragmatists as either somewhat
obnoxious and cold or as refreshingly helpful and skilled in practical
matters.
