Rationality and irrationality
====================================

**Rationality** / **Irrationality** (also called Shizotyme / Cyclotyme
or Rigid / Labile) is one of the 4 :doc:`Jungian dichotomies <jungian>`, and one of the 15 :doc:`Reinin dichotomies <reinin_dich>`. **Rationality** in socionics is a
perceptual quality defined by a focus on actions and emotions. In
contrast, **Irrationality** means a focus on states of mind and body.

Rational and irrational IM elements
-----------------------------------

:doc:`Jung <jung>` was the first to divide :doc:`psychic functions <functions>` into *rational* and *irrational*.

   Rational functions are the judging ones Thinking (T) and Feeling (F).
   Irrational functions are the perceiving ones Sensing (S) and
   Intuition (N).

Rational and irrational types
-----------------------------

Rational types are defined as any type that has a rational element (T/F) in its first or leading function.

Irrational types are defines as any type that has an irrational element (N/S) in its first or leading function.

-  **Rational**\ `types <socionic_type>`\ **are:**\ :doc:`ESE <ESE>`\ **,**\ :doc:`LII <LII>`\ **,**\ :doc:`EIE <EIE>`\ **,**\ :doc:`LSI <LSI>`\ **,**\ :doc:`LIE <LIE>`\ **,**\ :doc:`ESI <ESI>`\ **,**\ :doc:`LSE <LSE>`\ **, and**\ :doc:`EII <EII>`\ **.**
-  **Irrational**\ `types <socionic_type>`\ **are:**\ :doc:`ILE <ILE>`\ **,**\ :doc:`SEI <SEI>`\ **,**\ :doc:`SLE <SLE>`\ **,**\ :doc:`IEI <IEI>`\ **,**\ :doc:`SEE <SEE>`\ **,**\ :doc:`ILI <ILI>`\ **,**\ :doc:`IEE <IEE>`\ **, and**\ :doc:`SLI <SLI>`\ **.**

| In :doc:`four-letter code <type_names>`, a
  rational type is denoted with a lower-case letter "j" at the end,
  while irrationals have "p".
| For example, a type that has Ni in its first function (and Fe as
  second) is denoted as INF\ **p**. A type that has Fi in its first
  information channel (and Se in second) is denoted as ISF\ **j**.

Each :doc:`quadra <quadra>` has two rational and two irrational types - a
rational dual dyad and an irrational dual dyad.

Theoretical properties of rational and irrational types
-------------------------------------------------------

In socionics, four `IM elements <elements>` are rational (Te
|symbol_p.gif|, Fe |symbol_e.gif|, Ti |symbol_l.gif|, and Fi
|symbol_r.gif|), and four are irrational (Se |symbol_f.gif|, Ne
|symbol_i.gif|, Si |symbol_s.gif|, and Ni |symbol_t.gif|).

-  Rational :doc:`types <socionic_type>` contain rational elements on
   :ref:`accepting <accepting>` (odd) :doc:`functions <functions>` and
   irrational elements on :ref:`producing <accepting>` (even)
   :doc:`functions <functions>`.
-  Irrational :doc:`types <socionic_type>` contain irrational elements on
   :ref:`accepting <accepting>` (odd) :doc:`functions <functions>` and
   rational elements on :ref:`producing <accepting>` (even)
   :doc:`functions <functions>`.

Typical characteristics
-----------------------

Rationals
~~~~~~~~~

(*Also called*\ **shizotymes**\ *in early socionics literature*)

#. Tend to plan ahead, make decisions early.
#. Are more often rigid and stubborn.
#. Do not like to change their decisions.
#. Tend to finish what they started.
#. Usually have stiff movements.
#. Usually more 'authoritarian' leadership style.
#. Low stress tolerance.

Irrationals
~~~~~~~~~~~

(*Also called*\ **cyclotymes**\ *in early socionics literature*)

#. Tend to wait and see, more spontaneous.
#. Are more often flexible and tolerant.
#. Change their decisions frequently.
#. Tend to start new things without finishing them.
#. Usually have gentle movements.
#. Usually more 'democratic' leadership style.
#. High stress tolerance.

Additional Commentary and Notes
-------------------------------

For the purpose of typing, it should be noted that no type is either
completely rational or completely irrational. Every type in socionics
contains a mixture of rational and irrational functions and,
correspondingly, will display a mixture of rational and irrational
traits. Thus, not one person fits neatly into one or the other side of
this dichotomy, because every types has both rational and irrational
functions.

The Rational-Irrational dichotomy also gets affected by :doc:`type's subtypes <subtype>`. If the irrational function is accentuated in a
person's type, then irrational traits will become more prominent, and
vice versa for rational functions. This may pose a typing dilemma for
creative function subtypes. Types are designated as Rational or
Irrational based on their leading function, but a strongly expressed
creative function obscures the leading function in this case. Thus
creative subtypes may be mistaken for being the opposite of where their
leading function actually places them on this dichotomy, e.g. an IEI-Fe
may consider him or herself to be a rational type EIE, while an EIE-Ni
may consider him or herself to be an irrational IEI. To resolve this
dilemma, other type parameters should be taken into account and this
dichotomy should not be used alone when deciding on type.

Rationality and irrationality and :doc:`intertype relations <intertype>`
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This :doc:`dichotomy <dich>` plays a particularly important role in
:doc:`intertype interaction <intertype>`. Of the main four
:doc:`dichotomies <dich>` in socionics (the so-called ":doc:`Jungian foundation <jungian>`"), rationality/irrationality is the
only one that :doc:`dual <duality>` types have in common.
