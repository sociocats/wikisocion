Stratievskaya, Vera
============================

**Vera Izraylevna Stratiyevskaya** - author of one the most popular sets
of socionic type and intertype relationship
descriptions in the Russian
socionics community. She is known for producing some of the most
detailed, lifelike descriptions of socionic types available at her blog
`socionika-forever <http://socionika-forever.blogspot.com/>`__. These
thorough descriptions full of detailed behavior and more than a bit of
irony have been machine translated and made available in English, but
they are difficult to understand at times. However, quite a few
socionists and socionics hobbyists have criticized Stratiyevskaya for
portraying types of :doc:`Gamma quadra <gamma_quadra>` in more positive light
while exaggerating the weaknesses or peculiarities of types from other
quadra. This is most likely explainable by her own type being
:doc:`ESI <ESI>`; thus, her depictions of types and intertype relations are
said to be most accurate for Gamma types. Reading her profiles and
intertype relationship descriptions pertaining to types from other
quadra, especially Alpha, it should be kept in mind that she has written
these from the point of view of an outside observer that does not
provide a completely objective view. Stratiyevskaya self-types as ESI
(suggested extended typing: ESI-Se so/sx 6w7).

Biography
---------

-  Vera Izraylevna Stratiyevskaya (maiden name Heifetz) - the originator
   of natural approach of research in socionics, the author of the
   theory of the evolutionary origin of types of information metabolism
   and the theory of quadra complexes - was born on July 26, 1953 in
   Yessentuki, Stavropol Territory. Since 1954, she lived and studied in
   Leningrad (St. Petersburg).
-  In 1978 she completed her studies at LGPI of A. I. Herzen (State
   Pedagogical University in St. Petersburg).
-  From 1992 to 1993 she was engaged in popularization of Socionics,
   lectured, conducted socionics surveys and testing.
-  From 1993 to 1996 worked on the descriptions and characteristics of
   16 types of IM and in 1997 published them as a book titled "What
   needs to be done such that we won't separate".
-  Since 1997, basing on the author's theory of the evolutionary origin
   of IM types, was engaged in the development of the theory of
   intertype relations. Described the interaction of all 16 types of IM
   on 9 types of intertype relationships: dual, identical, mirror,
   activation, conflict, mirage, business, kindred, semi-dual. (For some
   TIMs other types of relationships have been described.)
-  Since 2000, from the standpoint of the author's theory of the
   evolutionary origin of IM types, is engaged in research and
   development in the theory of Reinin traits in the natural research
   orientation.
-  From 2007, leads a site on socionics, which regularly receives
   materials on all the above topics, including the latest additions and
   developments.
-  In 2009, documents her research on socionics quadra and quadra
   complexes ("The general concept of Quadra", "Characteristics of
   Quadra", "The general laws of quadra progression", the " The turnover
   of quadras aspects", etc).
-  Since 2009, within the framework of the project "Socionics in aid of
   history", she started working on a book titled "Two angles of time in
   the history of Richard III" which features a historical investigation
   with socionics comments (full text is available online).
-  Since 2010 lives in Canada. Is a member of the Canadian branch of the
   "Society of Richard III".
