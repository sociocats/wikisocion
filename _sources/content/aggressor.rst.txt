Aggressor
=================

The **Aggressor** types, identified as such by :doc:`Viktor Gulenko <gulenko>`, are the four types with Se |symbol_f.gif| in their
ego, two each in :doc:`Beta <beta_quadra>` and :doc:`Gamma <gamma_quadra>`: :doc:`SLE <SLE>`,
:doc:`LSI <LSI>`, :doc:`ESI <ESI>`, and `SEE <SEE>`.

Despite the differences between these types in terms of
:doc:`temperament <temperament>`, :ref:`base function <leading-func>`, and
:doc:`quadra <quadra>` :doc:`values <quadra>`, it seems that in the area of
physical attraction, desire, flirting, and the like, in intimate
relationships, the :doc:`irrational <ration_irration>` :ref:`ego <ego-block>`
:doc:`element <elements>` Se |symbol_f.gif|, coupled with their expectations
of Ni |symbol_t.gif| style behavior in intimate partners, is the most
visible factor in an Aggressor's behavior.

Typical characteristics of the Aggressor romance style
------------------------------------------------------

-  no doubts about own interest in another person
-  not prone to hesitation about whether or not to reveal that interest
-  focus is more on own interest than whether or not the other person
   might reciprocate
-  romantic interaction is more about "toughness" than "tenderness"
-  needs to feel some sense of "superiority" over the partner, but
   worthwhile only if the partner is seen as able to largely "keep up"
-  this takes the form of power games, which others might regard as
   cruel or bitchy
-  in the case of female Aggressors with male partners, the above tends
   to assume the characteristic of a woman expecting total devotion from
   the partner, rather than her being "bossy"
-  little inclination to externally admit not having been the one to end
   a relationship, unless if adopting a "who cares" front simultaneously

This romance style is defined by focus on |symbol_f.gif| which is
static, irrational, and extroverted. This means that an Aggressor sees
attraction to another person as a static state, which he feels it is up
to him to change in the direction more in agreement to his preference.
This accounts for an Aggressor's inclination to take the initiative in
approaching the object of his interest and being "relentless" in his
pursuit, as well as, even during an established relationship, continuing
to try to "shake things up" or "get things moving". If his partner is
not receptive to such behavior, this discourages the Aggressor, and
results in his interest cooling off.

Perception of other romance styles
----------------------------------

This refers to perceptions of the partner in a romantic or prospective
relationship.

:doc:`Aggressor <aggressor>`\ **:** Aggressors tend to perceive other
Aggressors as exciting partners worthy of admiration and respect, but
ultimately unsatisfactory due to a sense of never-ending competition for
an ill-defined "upper hand", which becomes frustrating.

:doc:`Victim <victim>`\ **:** Aggressors tend to perceive Victims
simultaneously as pleasantly able to "keep up" regarding more
"intensive" interactions, and also as not annoyingly prone to always
wanting "to win". Aggressor women perceive Victim men as totally devoted
yet reassuringly "strong".

:doc:`Caring <caring>`\ **:** Aggressors tend to perceive Caring types as
somewhat boring and patronizing.

:doc:`Childlike <childlike>`\ **:** Agressors tend to perceive Childlike
types as fun at first but ultimately too confusing, presenting multiple
alternatives with no discretion about how to act further, ultimately not
seeing in them what they need in a partner.

Description from :doc:`Life Scenarios <life_scenarios>` by V. Gulenko
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**"Aggressive"** man (SEE, ESI, LSI, SLE). This sociotype has an
inclination to forceful possession of a woman. In love games loves to
demonstrate a struggle. Can allow himself rudeness, sometimes causes
women pain - both physical and moral. Expects a woman to yield to force.

**"Aggressive"** woman (SEE, ESI, LSI, SLE). Often tries to compete with
men, including in erotic relations. Inclined to irony, ridicule, making
jokes at the opposite sex. Likes to feel herself more competent than a
man in any endeavor. During lovemaking she expects from a man
deferential treatment, demonstrative weakness, emotional instability.

"Aggressive" woman searches for an object for her assertive and eager
erotic actions. She is best matched by a man who behaves obediently but
capriciously with her. Then she obtains pretext for aggression. "Victim"
man idealizes such a woman, and at the same time he somewhat fears her.
His behavior can be compared with the behavior of a page who is entirely
devoted to the service of "beautiful lady". On-going game - is the best
cure for satiation. In relations with "Childlike" man, "Aggressive"
woman will feel a lack of playful submission on his part. His
unwillingness to adapt to her aggressive attacks cannot not put such a
union on the brink of a break-up. Relations with similar to her
"Aggressor" man on one hand flatter and ignite her passion, but on the
other hand repel, as they don't lead to the desired victory. Therefore,
they may have only mixed success. "Caring" man unnerves her with his
treatment of her as if she is a small child, which she perceives as
humiliating.
