Keirsey Temperament Theory
===================================

**Keirsey Temperament Theory** is a differential psychology theory which
resembles :doc:`Myers-Briggs Typology <MBTI>` and, to a
lesser degree, the Five-factor model.

Some people prefer KTT to MBT or socionics because it is simpler to use.
However, no publishing socionists rely on Keirsey's work, temperament
groups, or descriptions, which seem more distant from socionics than
:doc:`Myers-Briggs Typology <MBTI>`.



Dichotomies in KTT
------------------

KTT uses the same four-letter code as MBT, and
later, socionics, but they don't exactly mean the same
thing. Although KTT resembles MBT, they are not the same thing.

-  E / I = Expressive / Attentive
-  S / N = Observant, Concrete / Introspective, Abstract
-  T / F = Tough-minded / Friendly
-  J / P = Scheduling / Probing



Temperaments in KTT
-------------------

KTT doesn't distinguish any functions, information elements or any sort
of cognitive processes. KTT is more based on what he calls
"**temperaments**" :

-  SP - **Artisan** - Action-seeking
-  SJ - **Guardian** - Security-seeking
-  NF - **Idealist** - Identity-seeking
-  NT - **Rational** - Knowledge-seeking



Rings of KTT
------------

KTT has four rings.

-  **Temperaments** are 4 and use the two first rings.
-  **Intelligence types** are 8 and use the three first rings.
-  **Role variants** are 16 and use the four rings.



First ring - Concrete versus Abstract
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  S means **Concrete**
-  N means **Abstract**



Second ring - Cooperative versus Pragmatic
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  SJ and NF are **Cooperative**
-  SP and NT are **Pragmatic**



Third ring - Directive versus Informative
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  ST and NJ are **Directive**
-  SF and NP are **Informative**



Fourth ring - Expressive versus Attentive
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  E means **Expressive**
-  I means **Attentive**
