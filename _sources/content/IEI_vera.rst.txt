1st Function - Ni Introverted intuition
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Romantic and dreamer. To the IEI time is an elastic, creative material, which can be "compressed" or "extended" at his own discretion. Esenin can stop an instant because it "is wonderful", and admire it for as long as he desires.

The IEI greatly values his time, especially if it was spent on pleasant experiences. The time spent insufficiently interestingly and pleasantly is not simply lost time, but, in his understanding, is a kind of irritating oversight which, as much as possible, should not be permitted.

The IEI prefers to live by a flexible schedule that would allow him to manage his time conveniently and spontaneously. Feels upset if his plans do not actuate due to someone else's fault: if he wasn't invited over for a holiday or celebration, this is already an occasion for serious irritation. Still more painful for him are breakdowns in global positive plans: for example, when his calculations collapse and his hopes are not justified, when the close and desired goal suddenly proves to be distant and unattainable, when someone refuses his support and patronage and shakes him out from under "his wing" - all this for Esenin are unfortunate turns of events, with which he in no way can be reconciled, and which he will try by all forces to not allow to happen (and in the majority of the cases he accomplishes this).

In spite of his seemingly detached relation to life, the IEI is capable of sufficiently realistically evaluating what is happening around him. He knows how to foresee the course of events that is undesirable, knows how to avoid its impact, and how to "freeze" its impact in the time and thus mute its full force. The IEI knows how to draw away the point in time when conflict is ripe and the need for decisive discourse and explanations has come. He will change his tactics and will try to take the situation into his hands, so as to have time to prepare for the outcome (for example, he will find another source of sponsorship and assistance).

Esenin sets the pace of development of relations according to his own wishes, interests, and plans. He serves as a "director" of time, his own and that of other people. He subordinates events to his own tempo, and draws everyone to live by his own rhythm of life. If there is no hurry for him personally, then his conversation partner won't hurry anywhere either: he will simply get "stuck" in the measured pace of conversation. Esenin is like that fairy from folklore tales, which is able to turn the life of any person into a "sweet dream", "waking up" from which the person may feel being thrown far back in time, with a sense of irremediably lost opportunities. This makes Esenin a good partner for someone who is constantly moving forward, towards their goals and concrete targets – such as his dual Zhukov or SLE.

It frustrates Esenin when something does not transpire according to his "direction" and "orchestration". Especially, when the "critical moment" has come, which the IEI usually sees well: here he will "wake up" anyone from their "hibernation" and will make it clear that it is needed to act.

The IEI always has exactly as much time as he needs it. He does not set before himself goals that are too difficult and unrealistic. His day is not overloaded by matters. He always manages to arrive at the point which is necessary for him. He does not like to rigidly plan his day, to be "in captivity" of strict schedule or plans, neither immediate nor distant. To Esenin it is not compulsory to be punctual, especially if for him it is not necessary, however, if he desires so he will arrive in time.

Esenin knows how to put time to his benefit. He knows when to wait out a tumultuous period in a "quiet harbor", when to go into "hibernation" under somebody’s protection (most comfortably Esenin feels under the "wing" of his dual Zhukov).

Esenin frequently produces the impression of a person for whom success "walks right into his hands". With his acute intuitive sense, the IEI tries to choose the right time to "catch" his chance - a quality which many may envy, and which allows representatives of this type to arrange their lives successfully. The IEI also tries to keep in the course of news and events, from which he assesses the general direction of public opinion to know "where the wind is blowing". All new trends, all new developments and directions catch his attention.

The IEI doesn't believe in continuance and persistence of hardships, rather sees them as passing and alternating in time. Welcomes the arrival of critical moments. Thus, even, as it would seem, gloomy and depressing events the IEI may tell about with a smile. He doesn’t lose hopes and expects much from changes that comes after a crisis, and tries to put these changes to a benefit.

The IEI vehemently resists when someone imposes on him inadvisable, inexpedient, in his opinion, expenditures of time, and tries to prove the needlessness or pointlessness of such an investment. In these moments convincing him otherwise is very difficult, even futile, because in such cases the IEI is inclined to do as he wishes. (For example, an accompanist-Esenin during the play decided to arbitrarily shorten the musical break, which was an unpleasant surprise to both the actors and the director, because it seemed to him personally that the time of play was too lengthy.)

Esenin's time always belongs only to him. Even the time he spends at work he considers to be his own: if he wants to - he works, if he wishes to - he becomes distracted at his private affairs and conversations. Esenin greatly values his time, even when he is sharing it with others, and considers it a generous gift for which one must be grateful.

2nd Function - Fe Extraverted ethics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is the IEI's second value - the skill to create positive attitudes and to improve the moods of others by his presence - which the IEI generously shares with those around him.

To all the observed phenomena the IEI responds in an impressionable and quite dynamic emotional manner. It would seem that there doesn't exist in nature such an object, person, or event, that would leave him indifferent. This quality positively predisposes other people towards Esenin. It seems unthinkable to push away a person who is so sincerely captivated and excited by everything that is good in you, who sees in you so many interesting things that even you yourself haven't even imagined. Esenin also knows how to listen, empathically looking into the eyes of his conversation partner – it would seem that he has never heard anything wiser in his lifetime! His dear, kind, modest smile is like a reflection of a ray of sun lighting up his face. Sometimes his smile is dreamy, sometimes sly, but always well-wishing, optimistic, and encouraging.

The IEI's moods are also similar to a solar beam: affable, agreeable, affectionate, lighthearted, joyful. In a romantic-dreamy state of the soul the IEI thinks distractedly on some removed topic, and the entire world acquires bright colors, becomes filled by sunlight and "sparkles of fresh dew". This blissful as a sweet opium dream state, this fairy-tale sleep, which is desirable to prolong to infinity, but which will end precisely when Esenin will consider it necessary to put an end to it. Esenin dislikes when some external stimulus interferes with this illusory-ethereal harmony – in such moments he feels as the author of the ruined creation. (It would be incorrect to think of Esenin as a kind of "drug" which is meant to cloud the head or lull to sleep from vigilance. Absolutely not! His primary psychological task is to relax his dual, Zhukov (SLE), who is often stressed and inclined to overload himself.)

Esenin is a "craftsman" of attitudes and moods: whatever picture he paints - so it will be. This is the instrument of his influence on his surroundings – by this he can "reward" as well as punish. In his understanding, the mood or state always has a material component to it - alike a work of art. In cases when the atmosphere of "serene harmony" that he has created is not valued and rewarded properly, Esenin considers it necessary "to draw another picture", in other colors, no less bright and saturated. The IEI feels himself uncomfortable when the tone created by him does not find proper response and support by people around him. This may lead to sharp changes in his mood or state, or ever lead to a quarrel. (Mood for Esenin is a method to manipulate his environment.)

Almost no one else knows how to mercilessly say harsh words and furiously quarrel, amplifying his emotional influence, as the IEI. The IEI knows how to burn someone by words as if by red hot metal, masterfully applying words enough for his partner to learn the lesson and draw the conclusions from his own errors and to try to as soon as possible correct them, in order not to repeat hence. Again, such ethical influence is psychologically oriented at his dual, Zhukov (SLE), at his inert emotions and somewhat coarse ethics. That which for Zhukov is nothing more than an effective method of emotional activation, for others (more sensitive personalities) can be unbearably trying.

In interaction the IEI holds a close psychological distance, as a consequence of which he can feel himself too vulnerable and too dependent of his partner. Therefore his quarrels are a required measure, the purpose of which is - on one side - to adjust psychological distance, and from another side - to draw attention of his partner to potential problems and express his needs in a form in which they are most readily received by his dual. The IEI is unable to speak of his problems in a "business tone" - this in his understanding is too crude and tactless, as he is subconsciously oriented at vulnerable emotions and demonstrative pragmatism of Zhukov. Therefore, he considers that a tactful and subtle hint is enough for his partner to correctly understand him and offer his services.

The IEI knows how to tune to his partner, how to adjust and adapt to him. If, for some reason, making contact doesn't go down well, this is always a reason for the IEI to feel worried. He starts to contemplate on the reasons that he was not allowed to approach - perhaps this person is not as open as he seems, or may be even presents a danger (here the IEI's intuition of time with a minus sign takes a hold - the desire to distance from danger).

Giving ethical evaluations of qualities of people around him, the IEI does it in accord to his own state: if he is in a good mood, he praises the person and offers his compliments - and if he is poor mood he will be critical towards others. In upset and irritated state the IEI gets an insurmountable desire to say the "truth right to person's face" and may say the most unpleasant truthful things.

Periodically the IEI can initiate conflicts – these are means for him to find out his own position in the system of relations. The entire range of emotions and states of Esenin is not only his "artistic palette", but also his "instrumental set" and his "weapons storehouse". The IEI is confident in his charm and his appeal, in his "arsenal" of attractive and dear fronts, which he magnificently uses. Moreover, these these are not just external appearances but unique states of his soul.

3rd Function - Si Si Introverted sensing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The more strongly, vividly, and concretely an emotional image builds up for the IEI - the stronger the aspect of "sensing of sensations" is perceived by representatives of this type.

For this very reason, the IEIs take up occupations where their entire "emotional palette" finds the most intense application with much success - music, theater, poetry, and so forth. For example musicians-IEIs frequently perceive the beauty of sound precisely through its expressiveness: a beautiful sound - is one that is emotionally saturated and rich in overtones; an ugly sound - is an inexpressive, "empty", or dull one. The same applies to IEI's perception of color combinations: a beautiful combination - is the one that spurs some emotional image or rouses some emotional associations. (For example, designer-IEI for a long time and unsuccessfully was trying to select a combination of colors for his project, then, suddenly, being "in the right mood" he drew some picture, and from the colors of this picture he did his design work.)

.. note::
    Editor's note: These "happenstance" findings are contingent on IEI's particular form of thinking.

Representatives of this type usually consider themselves aesthetes, even though they continue developing their aesthetical taste for the duration of their entire life. They try themselves with pleasure in different creative spheres: attend shows, concerts, premiers. Whether he is an artist, an actor, or a musician, the IEI never limits himself to only one sphere.** The bright and lively impressions which he gathers from these different sources, he then transfers and realizes in the sphere of his professional activity.

.. note::
    Editor's note: Type descriptions like these encourage the stereotype of every artist, musician, producer or otherwise creative person getting typed as IEI, and sometimes EIE. In actuality, many IEIs are not involved in artistic work - for example, they may join the military and rise up the ranks, or choose to be a teacher or a university professor. Likewise there are many people of other types, some with strong Si, who try themselves in creative and artistic work sometimes with much success. Care should be taken to not confuse creative talent and occupation for a person's type.

The IEI actively follows all possible novelties and innovations in the cultural and artistic fields, reads modern magazines and advertising brochures - all of which can be seen in surplus in his house. The IEIs can for a long time save even random advertising slips that have found a way into their house. Simply because the IEI may like the picture, or maybe he dreams of one day purchasing the item. (And Esenin loves dreaming - he frequently mentally materializes his wishes - thus the photo is also a kind of materialization of his dream: "One day I will purchase this gadget!")

In their aesthetic orientation points, representatives of this type are characterized by certain contradictions: on one side - they are conservative in their tastes, on another side - they seek out and are open to everything new. With clothing the IEIs either wear that which they have grown used to, or a something that corresponds to latest style regardless of the fact of whether it complements him/her or not. Same applies to their gustatory senses: in parallel to the traditional and sufficiently monotonous food the IEI can prepare some extravagant dish of rather experimental taste combinations. When the IEI feels obstructed within the established sensory framework and no longer inspired by that which he has already seen, tasted, sensed, and experienced many times, he is not against trying some new, at times aesthetically contradictory sensory experiences.

Entering into the social light, the IEI loves to demonstrate his gallant manners. He strives to look refined and elegant. Feels comfortable in an atmosphere of splendor and comfort. Enjoys surrounding himself with beautiful things. Loves to give others small charming gifts. Of course Esenin is not going to object against money as a gift (but he quickly spends it, not even remembering on what). To IEI it is always pleasant to receive a memorable, expensive, and beautiful item, about which it would be possible to say: "Your cookware set looks so splendid, everyone says about it "what a charm!..." Well, if everyone says so, then it is possible to say that it is delightful indeed. The IEI's aesthetical taste is frequently formed under the effect of opinion of people around him or her.

Some problems present themselves before Esenin in organization of his household and his way of life, in creation of comfort and coziness, and in maintenance of cleanliness and order. The IEI initially takes up such chores with enthusiasm, but quickly grows cold after he runs into some difficulties. Not liking to spend his time on such unpleasant matters, the IEI thus rarely succeeds in organizing a "comfortable nest" for himself and maintaining it in order. He is subconsciously expecting help from someone else in making such sensory provisions.

Such a possibility indeed presents itself in the person of his dual, the SLE,** who, with characteristic of him extraverted sensing directness, is capable of saying first thing upon entering someone's house: "Not bad, not a bad apartment ... here the parquet should be fixed, here we will paint this cabinet over..." Maybe, someone else would become alarmed by such displays of sensory initiative - but not Esenin: quite to the contrary the IEI will be happy to receive any help being offered. The IEI with pleasure relies on SLE's skill to organize high-quality and convenient way of life, while he retains the right to inspire his dual with his own "creative dreams".

.. note::
    Editor's note: Other types with strong sensing, such as LSI, ESI, SLI, ESE, usually also help the IEI to set up a "cozy nest" and improve his material well-being, though in different manner than his dual.

4th Function - Te Te Extraverted logic
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The IEI does not fall into the category of people who are always initiative-taking, energetic, and business-oriented. And for this there are many reasons.

First of these reasons is that the IEI does not like to spend his time on work if he doesn’t enjoy it or if it somehow disagrees with him. The IEI can be seen working at his computer and simultaneously listening to music; accompanying on the piano and simultaneously reading a book; reading a new chapter out of a textbook while following a sportscast on television.

The second reason is that the IEI feels that one ought not to hurry doing his work: perhaps it won’t be need by anyone, maybe someone else will want to do it. In other words, one should work at a low pace so as to not to fall under high standards.

The desire to work in Esenin appears very rarely, and even then he puts off work until the last minute, sometimes such that it never gets done. At times, this has no consequences for him - other times this leads to the IEI losing his work position. (However, he sufficiently quickly finds other work, but if he cannot, he will find someone to look after him.)

In order to do work, the IEI needs to be in the working mood. But where to get such a mood if the IEI is constantly either in a blissful-enthusiastic state of soul or strained and irritated state? Most often Esenin is simply too relaxed, and simultaneously he has a relaxing effect on those around him, leaving nobody around who could provide him with a "volitional impulse", while he finds it exceptionally difficult to mobilize himself by his own efforts. Furthermore, something strange happens to Esenin's organism: as soon as he sits down to work, he immediately either wants to eat, or to go for a smoke, or to drink something, or simply feels sleepy. The IEI is sometimes so bored by his occupation, that he uses any opportunity to get distracted by external interactions. However, if there are none in direct vicinity, he will willingly create common activities. Representatives of this type fairly often succeed in making for themselves not a bad career, though it's not always due to their business qualities.

Esenin is usually aware of these qualities in himself, and therefore he tries to create himself all conditions needed to work productively. Sometimes at home he organizes a separate room as his working office: will bring there an enormous writing desk and many office stationeries, will arrange books on the shelves, hang calendars on walls, then bring there a TV, then a sofa- bed...

And the piles on Esenin’s desk! These are not even "obstructions" - these are real "Scythian barrows", where it is possible to dig out something that was considered lost many years ago.

Esenin dislikes leaving his things at someone else's house, since he considers that they might not get returned. But he doesn’t mind if someone else leaves their things at his place. He jokes about the fact that he quickly grows accustomed to unfamiliar things (as much as his own), and the more he needs the item - the quicker he grows accustomed to it, and the more difficult it becomes for him to part with it.

Same with money: the IEI may purchase for himself an extensive wallet with many compartments and divisions to keep in it money and receipts. But money won't remain for long in these pockets, especially if the IEI doesn't live alone and not with his dual - he will feel an overwhelming desire to spend it. Sometimes he as if competes with its partner in spending ability, preferring to spend on himself instead of waiting for it to get taken for the "common pot". (This is another manifestation of Esenin's Beta Quadra complex - to do everything possible so as not to remain in disadvantage.)

The IEI dislikes taking responsibility onto his shoulders (by this quality he complements his dual, the SLE, very well, who prefers to independently resolve, decide, and be answerable for everything). For this very reason, the IEI tries to place responsibility onto someone else – a quality which creates many problems for other people when representatives of this type occupy a position of responsibility.

The IEI frequently draws out and postpones adopting a resolution to a question that only he could carry out: it seems to him that time will suggest the right solution, or someone will get tired of waiting and then responsibility can fall to him. Sometimes the IEI doesn't want to give his guests "scarce and dear information", then he may pretend to be incompetent rather than risk of being accused of disclosing some secrets.

At times he will mix up the sequence of steps in some production, other times he will misinform his visitors, and yet at other times he will forget some important information. If the IEI is in position of authority, such mistakes can cost dearly to his subordinates and visitors. Especially because Esenin dislikes checking the results of his work. Esenin-accountant can quietly lose some numbers or documents, forget to make a note of some payment, and thus create in records an astronomical debt, which will grow further with percentages.

And nevertheless it cannot be said that the IEI is incapable of doing something beneficial and useful. Among representatives of this type one can encounter both skillful individuals and hard workers. Let us say so: the IEI can do anything which to he deems as desired and necessary to himself. The problem is in the fact that he does not always realize what this might be. To constantly force him to do work is also impossible. And not only because no partner, except for Zhukov, will have sufficient forces and health to do so, but also because finding himself in unsuitable working conditions the IEI simply begins to grow weak and falls sick. The IEI cannot be used a work horse to "plough through the field" on him, because this is not the strongest and most enduring sociotype: the IEI has weak sensing functions, and this is a very serious matter.

Only having his dual, the SLE, nearby can save this situation. (Representatives of other types risk getting stuck themselves in IEI's field of relaxation, since the IEI also decelerates any activity of his environment.) Only Zhukov with its exceptional fitness for work and purposefulness can allow himself to relax slightly under IEI's influence, as well as inspire the IEI to work in the most productive and optimal to the IEI regime. Zhukov is the only one of all types who is capable of doing this.

5th Function - Se Extraverted sensing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The IEI not only respects confident and goal-oriented people, but also admires them. He wants to be near them, to be "taken under their wing", to be needed and useful for them. He is always happy if he wins over their friendship and trust, and gladly accepts their patronage.

The IEI has a talent for finding such people who could provide him with their support. He has a kind of natural tactic for selecting his supporters: there are those who are less effective but friendly to him, and those who are actually influential but whose positive predisposition he has not attained yet.

Esenin does not like to befriend the "wimps" and the "hapless". He does not respect the "unlucky wretches" who don't know how to make useful contacts, who are not capable of standing up for themselves, who cannot "work with their elbows" pushing others aside and moving towards their goal. Esenin does not understand them at all. Sometimes, as a consequence of this trait of this type, the IEI falls under the influence of people who know how to magnificently bluff and create an illusion of power and influence, and who can in this manner hold the IEI "on a hook" while they use his help. Though the IEI tries to avoid this course of events, sometimes he falls into this trap when he mistakes the desired for the real. (Furthermore, "for any wise person there is enough simplicity": there are "intuitive" individuals who are much more clever than Esenin.)

The IEI never boasts about his own strength. He never demonstrates it and prefers to not participate in any power contests. He won't be provoked or "taken on a dare" - he doesn't consider himself to be in the same "weight category", and doesn't view it as shameful to seem weak, because he knows how to use this weakness. He sees nothing terrible in looking poor and unprotected - otherwise, who would help him?

If he needs it, the IEI can evoke sympathy in others. Even as an adult he can burst into tears if he is being pushed away and rejected. Moreover, the IEI won't view this as a sign of weakness or something shameful. However, the person who has refused him, who has shown indifference, may feel the burden of guilt - thus Esenin laments and reproaches at the same time. And indifference when he was facing troubles and hardships Esenin will not forgive. (The IEI in general forgives little. Good things he may forget, but evil and malice – never! As well as hurtful and malicious actions committed towards people who are close to him, the IEI will not forget and continue to remind: "Have you forgotten how poorly he has treated you? Why do you want to aid him now?")

Esenin's weakness has the same origin as Zhukov's strength: if Zhukov tries to seem stronger in order to not surrender anything, then Esenin for the same reason appears weak, so that he won't get used or tricked. This is a manifestation of the same quadral complex - to not be put into disadvantage - only in the intuitive interpretation.

Esenin has his own methods of supporting himself that are founded on fine emotional influencing and precise intuitive estimations. It is interesting to observe how Esenin involves others to be his guardians: for example, coming to a restaurant (or a store) he may say, with a charming spontaneity, that he doesn’t have money on him, and do so in the moment when it's necessary to pay. And again, he says it not simplybecause, but being confident that among those present someone has the money, and that this someone regards him so well that he or she could pay on this occasion. (Esenin may not even openly say anything, but with a modest look wait until the question is settled without his participation.) His own solvency does not matter: even if he has money, why not to allow someone else to pay if that person so wishes? Maybe, this person really wanted to do so, especially when they have already spent the time pleasantly in each other's company. (Appropriate to recall that Esenin is always confident in his charm, in youth especially.)

Concerning money questions, perhaps the IEI produces the impression of someone impractical, but someone with a mind of his own, someone who won't ever go against his own benefit, and who is not easily hyped up to make some "unnecessary" in his view expenditure. Although Esenin usually considers himself to be of generous nature. It is necessary to note that this unconscious tactic is oriented at Esenin's dual Zhukov, who is also sufficiently economical. Although this tactic isn't applied to the SLE: only for as long as is required for the IEI to assess true merits of his dual and decide to not argue over trifles in order to not lose his dual's protection and friendship. In turn the SLE, who actually also doesn't like when he is being prompted to pay extra, does not consider expenditures on Esenin a great loss, especially if he has actually enjoyed his dual's company (but if he did not, he easily parts with Esenin without regrets, and no one is offended).

The ability to use someone else's force doesn't exclude the desire to develop one's one. However, as everyone else, Esenin does this primarily for his own enjoyment. He rarely finds application to his own physical strength, although sometimes, being in the appropriate mood, he can play the role of a defender or get involved in a fight on the behalf of his friends, but performing hard and strenuous physical labor is not for him.

The IEI occasionally finds it difficult to make a willful effort. Sometimes, as he jokes himself, he takes himself "by the collar", and "drags" himself to the work place. But it is better when the necessary impulse of "willful motivation" is given to him by his dual Zhukov.

Esenin, just as Zhukov, is aware of the established order and will never go against people with power. Just as Zhukov, he will join the opposition only when there is a certain secure benefit to himself. He is just as conforming. He prefers to not voice his personal opinion if it is contradictory and goes against the opinion of the majority. If necessary, he is capable of relinquishing his personal persuasions and values or changing them.

The IEI will with pleasure work in a public system, especially in positions related to ideological activity, and in conditions of flexible working hours.

6th Function - Ti Introverted logic
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The IEI is very much activated by possibilities of gathering information which he views as important. Despise his apparent absent-mindedness, he is sufficiently observant and with ease finds those who can tell him something interesting. By information gathering the IEI renders an especially valuable service to his dual the SLE, for whom "knowledge" is another form of strength and protection. Just as the SLE, the IEI considers that information is valuable and that learning and acquiring new knowledge is very beneficial.

The IEI is very adept at collecting and reviewing information. He gathers it from many sources - most comprehensive and most reliable. The selection of information and its analysis is carried out by him very thoroughly: the most valuable information the IEI retains for himself and shares with people who are dear to him.

The IEI won't allow anyone else to hide things from him, moreover, he prompts people naturally and without constraint. It is sufficient for him to want to know - and he will learn everything that is of interest to him. IEI's curiosity knows no boundaries, and at times it's not even bounded by decency. With an innocent look the IEI can ask rather tactless questions (of type: "And who has helped you with getting accepted?"), and with this he is fully confident that he will receive a response. It is very difficult to hide anything from the IEI, but it is even more difficult to obtain from him information that he doesn't want to share, that has the potential of being harmful.

The IEI greatly dislikes being misinformed or informed untimely, although he himself may do both things. The IEI does not forgive craftiness and treachery exercised in such a manner, and it is precisely in such situations that it is possible to turn him into one's enemy (and this is very dangerous!): when the IEI understands that someone has fooled him, that someone is trying to outsmart him and play him, IEI's quadral complex of not being put into a disadvantage leads him to worsen his relations with the offender.

For the IEI it is difficult to be logically consistent, though he doesn't particularly strive for this. He can easily contradict himself however many times, while believing that he's reasoning in a sufficiently logical and astute manner.

In order to logically out-argue the IEI, one doesn't need to use particularly weighty arguments. The IEI wins in debates not by logic but by ethics. And out-arguing him is extremely difficult. He is too adept at derailing arguments, directing them aside to irrelevant issues, turning things personal and starting to sort out relations.**

.. note::
    Editor's note: This tactic is most commonly employed by IEIs of ethical subtype - at some point in the argument they may start to comment about the other person's personal qualities, their social standing in a group, their relationships with others, turning the argument from logical to personal basis. This tactic is also used by other ethical irrationals of ethical subtypes, such as Fi-SEE, who use their strong ethical creative function to insert "personal retorts" and "cover up" their disinclination to give logical explanations.

The IEI experiences difficulty with tracing the full sequential course of logical reasoning – it is hard for a person of this type to grasp an expanded and extensive logical analysis in its entirety. The IEI much readily receives and understands short purposeful logical statements provided by his dual, the SLE, who is capable of explaining the most difficult concepts in the most simple and easily accessible terms, and of finding the most convincing arguments and putting them in such order that would make them convincing to another person. Forms of explanations of other logical types don't suit the IEI.** They seem either by too needlessly entangled and complicated, or too removed and unrelated to the matter at hand (which greatly irritates him). SLE's logic, in this respect, is the most optimal for him and most convincing.

.. note::
    Editor's note: This is not completely true, as IEIs are also receptive to the logical explanations delivered by LIIs, though these explanations, while being informative and intellectually enriching, don't mobilize the IEI as does SLE's argumentation.

Speaking on any topic, the IEI does not pretend to objectivity of his own opinion. For him assessing how much his own opinion correlates with opinions of people around him is more important.**

.. note::
    Editor's note: This applies to all Subjectivist types, who coordinate and compare individual views.

The IEI loves to discuss and think about detached and distant themes, but usually does not consider himself to be a "deep" philosopher: he does this "under the right mood" and for his own enjoyment and not for a thorough in depth study.

Memorizing study material and figuring out logical concepts for the IEI is rather difficult. Attempt to give logical definition to his own words ... it's better not to ask him to do this.

Delivering lectures on scientific and technical subjects are also not IEI's cup of tea. If Esenin needs to deliver a research report, read a lecture, or pass examination on theoretical and technical disciplines, he always tries to use humor to cover up for his helplessness. (Though this doesn't always save him. For example: during a pregraduate examination in electronics, a student-Esenin, after instructor gave him a transistor, imprudently exclaimed: "Wow, look at these wires! They are like antennae of ants!") Rarely does one find representatives of this type teaching theoretical disciplines. (Perhaps only at the most basic level, for the children in starting classes.)**

.. note::
    Editor's note: This is an untrue stereotype. Some IEIs do go on to receive graduate degrees in physical sciences, as well as mathematics, philosophy, computer science, etc. and sometimes work in such fields on the level of a tenured professor. However, the incidence of this is perhaps lower than for types such as ILE.

7th Function - Ne Extraverted intuition

The IEI likes people "with possibilities", people who have "potential". His new acquaintances, first of all, are evaluated from this point of view. A person who doesn't know how to present himself well does not hold IEI's attention, while getting acquainted with an interesting for himself person the IEI will take everything onto his shoulders - an interesting conversation, a pleasant pastime, aid in common matter, valuable information and connections - in one word, everything. The IEI is adept at evaluating potential and possibilities of a person, moreover he evaluates not only who this person is now, but also who he or she could be, and, most importantly, wants to be. For this very reason, Esenin respectfully treats prospective plans, goals, and purposes of his dual Zhukov, and feels himself protected around him.

The IEI subconsciously observes which possibilities are presented by various situations and relationships. He always and everywhere strikes up many acquaintances - important or insignificant it doesn't matter: any of them can prove to be useful. (With age, the IEI becomes more selective in his contacts.) He immediately evaluates the potential and possibilities of each acquaintance, and tries to avoid tying ties that may become burdensome in future (in order to not spend his time on unnecessary interaction). Esenin has a keen eye for the "unlucky wretches". These people do not interest him. To interact with them he considers to be a luxury that he cannot afford for himself. At the same time, the IEI keeps an enormous quantity of information about each familiar person in his memory, and constantly supplements it with new, diverse information, by which he sometimes creates the impression of a pathologically curious person. He likes to advertise and praise the capabilities, talents, positive qualities, and potential of people who are close to him.

From his side, Esenin also has something to offer. He also knows how to present his abilities in the most advantageous light (though sometimes he bluffs with this). He's even not afraid of talking about his failures, because he is able present them favorably. He also doesn't miss the opportunity to mention important connections, but does this casually, not focusing too much attention on this. (He tries to be farsighted and not say anything in excess.) Feels unsure when he is directly asked for his patronage and help. From one side, he doesn't want to refuse a person, from another he doesn't want to share valuable connections (so that later he's not "moved aside"). For this very reason Esenin is very careful in making promises and offering his services. He is not discouraged if he is rarely asked for help, although he may express his regrets about this. He willingly helps in cases when it doesn’t interfere with his own plans, and only those people who may offer him their support later. (Most willingly Esenin helps his dual Zhukov, whose merits he readily sees and whose friendship is dear to him.)

Esenin feels concerned when he is "passed by", when an opportunity or chance slips by his hands. He is always very interested in prospective plans of people who surround him, and especially which role he has in their plans. If nobody cared for him, the IEI won't go around asking for himself – he will simply become "creatively" offended.

If the IEI is signed up to participate in some program, he won't tolerate simply getting "crossed out". After being accepted into the program, the IEI starts to pull good opportunities and chances towards himself – tries to turn the maximum attention to himself, to take up the maximum amount of time, not leaving space for others. (Esenin has his own methods of "working with his elbows" to promote himself.)**

.. note::
    Editor's note: This is more applicable to IEIs in image triad (2,3,4) particularly types 4w3 and 3w4 which are characterized by feelings of competitive envy, but may not be as descriptive of IEIs of other enneagram types (e.g. IEI 9, 6)

Sometimes the IEI experiences the wish to be in the different places at the same time - it suddenly seems to him that he has been sitting in one place for far too long, and thus he has missed out on some opportunities that perhaps someone else is using now.

At times the IEI wants to test boundaries of the permissible and allows himself to take some bold and daring actions. If he successfully accomplishes this, he's always happy and will remember and retell it with enthusiasm if he managed to pull some ruse and not get reprehended for it.

The IEI as if unconsciously "probes the ground" of any situation in attempts to find its "critical point". Subconsciously directing the situation, the IEI can aggravate a crisis or smooth it over, draw it nearer or delay it. This he does not only for himself, but also for his dual Zhukov. The SLE "manages" the arrangement of forces in the space, while the IEI "manages" the arrangement of forces in the time.

8th Function - Fi Introverted ethics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The INFp (IEI) does not take on the role of ethical analyst, and does not engage in meticulous analysis and explications of ethics and morals. If he encounters an unethical act, he will bring it up for discussion with other people and make his conclusions after he receives input from others. The IEI may for however long discuss the ethics of behavior and actions of people around him, but prefers not to talk or make judgement on the topic of morals.

It could be said that the aspect of ethics of relation (Fi) for the IEI is composed of two parts: the ethics of actions and emotional relation towards a subject. IEI's own personal moral code is either dispersed between these two points, or not included in either.

The IEI's behavior is characterized by demonstratively expressed "charm of soul". Especially vividly this manifests in the beginning, when relations are just being established. Esenin shows himself in the best possible light: expresses sincere admiration of his partner's talents, shows deepest goodwill, cordiality, participation, compassion, and so on.

Of course, such active use of his most heartfelt resources moves the IEI to rapidly and accurately estimate the potential possibilities of his partner, and then draw respective conclusions on how relations should be developed further. (Ethical interrelations for Esenin are also a search for the "wing", the search of patron, defender, and protector. Esenin sees nothing wrong if other people offer their help in solving his problems. Thus, he doesn't see it necessary to hide his problems, and allows other to take an active part in their resolution. Esenin speaks reluctantly of his well-being, while of his problems he talks willingly and at length, but only with those who are able to help him.)

The IEI may speak of how he or she is lonely and has no social life, but in actuality the IEI won't allow him or herself to be truly lonely, as this would lower Esenin's self-esteem: it is impossible that a person of such charm, such beauty and fine emotional influence couldn't create an environment that would appreciate his "soulful" grace, and in exchange gift him with its "physical beauty". There are also the numerous connections that the IEI creates at both friendship level and level of acquaintances, due to which he/she never truly experiences a deficit in social interaction.

And nevertheless, the IEI searches for stability in any relations, though he doesn't always consider it possible to provide it from his end. The development of ethical side of relations of the IEI depends on how constant is his interest and his sympathies towards a partner.

In a partner the IEI respects strength, confidence in oneself, and tendency not to stop on what has already been achieved. Therefore, the SLE is the only type of personality who can count on continuous interest and stability in relations from the IEI. Representatives of other types have less chances of winning the IEI over. And it is exactly for the SLE that the IEI renders the most effective support: the IEI creates a comfortable positive emotional background, discharges excess stress, relaxes his dual, protects him ethically, and warns regarding "suspicious" and potentially dangerous people. Thus, for the SLE there remains only to distribute his forces taking into account IEI's advice. Representatives of other types usually take Esenin's "advice" to be empty gossip or completely unnecessary information. The SLE is the only type who can appreciate this information by its true merit and repay with his trust and gratitude.
