Socionics types of famous people
====================================

This page is a catalog of famous people whose types are of general interest.

In socionics communities it is typical for the members to create lists, databases, and galleries of famous people to compare and discuss their typings with each other, as well as benchmark lists for newcomers to have real life examples of different sociotypes. A couple of such benchmark typings are presented below.

The purpose of this section is to present evidence for likely types of each famous person. If there is only one type presented, this does not mean that this typing is unanimous and that other opinions aren't possible.

To see famous people's typings done in Russian-speaking communities and to compare their type votes, including several well-known socionists, see the SSS database of types.

.. note::
    The typing of famous people might be very controversial because we only know a small aspect of them. The following typings are from the old archived version of Wikisocion and it's accuracy is not guaranteed.
