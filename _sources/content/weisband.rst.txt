Igor Weisband
===========================

**Igor Weisband** was an early socionist and made significant
contributions to the field in the 1980s when he lived in Kiev, Ukraine.

K?ln) and speaks German and English as well as Russian and Ukrainian.
Since his move, he has not been active in the publishing socionics
community, but he continues to apply socionics in his personal and/or
business activities. For a while he maintained a site on socionics in
German, but it has since disappeared. You can find current information

Contributions to Socionics
--------------------------

Weisband has compiled the first full set of type descriptions (Augusta
had only completed descriptions of 7 types out of 16). He has requested
many people who were involved in socionics at the time to write personal
accounts, then filtered these accounts to eliminate any parts that were
not type related on basis of Model A. He has created the first socionics
textbook "Working materials (1st version came out in 1985). This
textbook has undergone numerous revisions and has been published several
times with contractions. At times Weisban published under the name of
Onufrienko (last name of his wife).

Thus, "Weisband's" type descriptions actually consist entirely of
material drawn from Augusta's own writings. Weisband has also created a
simple type test consisting of a "tree" of four dichotomies. Weisband
has mentioned that he created all these instruction materials to have
something to give to people who were interested in studying and
discussing socionics.

He has also traveled extensively around the Soviet Union offering
consulting services and helping start informal socionics clubs. He is
credited with bringing socionics to the most distant parts of the
country.
