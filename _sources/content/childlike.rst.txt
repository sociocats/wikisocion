Childlike
=================

The **Childlike** types were identified as such by :doc:`Viktor Gulenko <gulenko>`, are the four types with extroverted intuition Ne
|symbol_i.gif| in their ego block. There are two of these types in
:doc:`Alpha <alpha_quadra>` and two in :doc:`Delta <delta_quadra>` quadra: :doc:`ILE <ILE>`,
:doc:`LII <LII>`, :doc:`IEE <IEE>`, and :doc:`EII <EII>`.

Despite the differences between these types in terms of
:doc:`temperament <temperament>`, :ref:`base function <leading-func>`, and
:doc:`quadra <quadra>` :doc:`values <quadra>`, it seems that in the area of
physical attraction, desire, and flirting, the ego element Ne
|symbol_i.gif|, coupled with their expectations of Si |symbol_s.gif|
style behavior in intimate partners, is the most significant factor in
determining their behavior that has been called "child-like'".


Typical Characteristics of "Childlike" Romancing Style
------------------------------------------------------

-  Interest is sparked by a partner with positive aesthetic attributes,
   divorced from active, direct sexuality.
-  Try attracting partner's interest with fun and interesting
   conversation and discussion, proposals, humor, ethical and mental
   exploration, and quirky statements.
-  Try to help their partner see the unexpected, potential, and
   alternative side of things.
-  Interest is maintained or cools off according to partner's response
   to the above behavior.
-  Appreciate partners who are attentive to their needs, which are not
   necessarily physical. If the partner does not meet their needs, they
   may not say anything and instead try to endure and last on their own.
   If their needs are not met by their partner, their satisfaction
   considerably decreases resulting in temper outbreaks and arguments as
   they become more demanding.

This romance style is defined by focus on Ne |symbol_i.gif| which is a
static, irrational, and extroverted element focused on processing
information about potential possibilities and alternatives to the static
present reality, which the individual perceives as intrinsically boring
and stagnant. This means that the Childlike type sees attraction between
two individuals as a static state, which he tries to "get moving" by
actively thinking of and voicing various options and variations to the
present static state. This accounts for Childlike type's inclination to
focus on the mutual attraction, or particularly the attraction felt by
the other person, as connected to that person's being exposed to the
unexpected, imaginative, fun, even unusual and improbable side of
reality in conversation, and each other, a behavior that can be
described as "childlike". This focus on the alternative and fun leads to
a sort of inattentiveness regarding their own material conditions,
quality of life, and well-being perceived by Si |symbol_s.gif|, so these
types welcome help, support, and efforts from others exerted in this
area.

Perception of other romance styles
----------------------------------

This refers to perceptions of the partner in a romantic or prospective
relationship.

:doc:`Aggressor <aggressor>`\ **:** Childlike types tend to perceive
Aggressors as a bit too "rough" and even slightly scary on occasion, or
perhaps just as obnoxious.

:doc:`Victim <victim>`\ **:** Childlike types tend to perceive Victims as
paranoid and confusing, giving mixed signals.

:doc:`Caring <caring>`\ **:** Childlike types tend to perceive Caring types
as comforting and pleasant company, with a delightful sense of fun.

:doc:`Childlike <childlike>`: Childlike types tend to perceive other
Childlike types as fun to spend time with, but also as helpless and
demanding in a way that they see as stressful.


Description from :doc:`Life Scenarios <life_scenarios>` by V. Gulenko
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**"Childlike"** man (ILE, LII, EII, IEE). Dependent, naive in worldly
affairs, awaits from a woman practical and sincere support.
Inadvertently emphasizes how he was passed by with attention and gone
unnoticed, any of the wasted abilities and talents, and difficulties
with adapting to life's struggles. In women he values experience and
responsiveness to his problems.

**"Childlike"** woman (ILE, LII, EII, IEE). The ideal of this woman is a
kind, experienced, well-adapted to life man, who is usually older than
her in age. In the presence of such a man she feels herself alike a
girl, who is dependent on him almost in everything. In love games she
prefers psychological factors - sincere conversation, predisposing
music, creation of conditions for relaxation. Above all, she values
leniency and support, attention to her problems, and care.

"Childlike" woman. In erotic life, women of this type place much
significance on sophisticated tenderness and psychology of relations.
She, without any special for it intentions, demonstrates by her own
actions her fragility and child-like naivete. This woman easily takes up
interests and activities of a partner towards whom she is sympathetic.
In love games, "Childlike" woman easily picks up the initiative of
"Caring" man, demonstrating her own sophistication and imagination. She
does pay attention to "Aggressive" men, of course, but she fears
becoming close with them due to their instinctive behavior and their
roughness. "Victim" men satisfy her only in part: they start off
romantically, but then puzzle and confuse her by demonstrations of their
suffering and their unpredictability. With similar to her "Childlike"
men this woman will feel discomfort due to lack of attention and care
for her needs. In such a couple the degree of alienation will slowly
increase over time.
