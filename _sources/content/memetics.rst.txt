Memetics
===============================

**Memetics** is an approach to evolutionary models of information
transfer based on the concept of the *meme*. The term "meme" (IPA:
/mi?m/), coined and popularized in 1976 by the biologist Richard
Dawkins, refers to a "unit of cultural information" which can propagate
from one mind to another in a manner analogous to genes (i.e., the units
of genetic information).

Memetics shares some common ground with socionics. Both are highly
theoretical fields (memetics even more so than socionics) that struggle
with the process of concreticizing concepts and generating falsifiable
predictions. Both arose as a sort of "thought experiment" that later
found applications in reality. Socionics could possibly be applied to
memetics and provide a language for describing different kinds of memes
(based on the eight :doc:`information aspects <information_aspect>`).
:doc:`Types <socionic_type>` may be more susceptible to memes that are conveyed
using their :ref:`valued <valued>` :doc:`elements <elements>`.
