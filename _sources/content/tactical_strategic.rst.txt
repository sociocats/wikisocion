Tactical and strategic
============================

**Tactical** / **strategic** is one of the 15 `Reinin dichotomies <reinin_dich>`.


Tactical and strategic types
----------------------------

-  The tactical :doc:`IM types <socionic_type>` are : :doc:`ILE <ILE>`,
   :doc:`ESE <ESE>`, :doc:`LSI <LSI>`, :doc:`IEI <IEI>`, :doc:`ILI <ILI>`,
   :doc:`ESI <ESI>`, :doc:`LSE <LSE>`, and :doc:`IEE <IEE>`.
-  The strategical :doc:`IM types <socionic_type>` are : :doc:`SEI <SEI>`,
   :doc:`LII <LII>`, :doc:`EIE <EIE>`, :doc:`SLE <SLE>`, :doc:`SEE <SEE>`,
   :doc:`LIE <LIE>`, :doc:`EII <EII>`, and :doc:`SLI <SLI>`.
-  Using the :doc:`four-letter code <type_names>`: tactical types are
   NP or SJ, strategical types are NJ or SP.

Typical characteristics
-----------------------

Tactics
~~~~~~~

#. Focus on methods, and manipulate them, with goals unsettled.
#. Goals are defined by, and modified to fit methods.
#. Prefers to expand options. Doesn't like to have too few of them.

Strategy
~~~~~~~~

#. Focus on goals, and manipulate them, with methods unsettled.
#. Methods are defined by, and modified to fit goals.
#. Prefers to defend goals. Doesn't like to be forced to deviate from
   them.

Extended characteristics
------------------------

Taken from :doc:`2003 study of Reinin traits <reinin_study>`.

Tactics
~~~~~~~

-  Tactical types focus their attention on their current situation, on
   the nearest action, on the actual choicesin other words, they are
   more oriented at their course, the chain of events, instead of the
   goal towards which this chain may lead.
-  As a rule, they do not "fix" for themselves a single "point" which
   they want to hit or reachin other words, a goal. Thus, the direction
   in which they are moving is liable to change.
-  In contrast to Strategic types, they are not inclined to constantly
   compare their current actions with the desired end state ("goal").
   The emerging goals are evaluated in accordance to how well they fit
   their current route (how well the goal coincides with the direction
   they are adhering to).
-  All possibilities of events occurring now or those that have occurred
   in the past (that which has occurred or could have occurred) i.e.
   different scenarios, outcomes, they perceive as equivalent (equally
   likely to happen and equally likely to have happened).
-  They consciously do not set goals or do it very rarely (when
   pressured by the circumstances). They avoid setting distant (very
   long-term or global) goals: "Why planyou still need to live to that
   moment".
-  Tactical types consciously operate with routes/pathwaysthey examine
   and contrast many different possible variations of present events and
   actions they can undertake (i.e. pathways), arrange them according to
   some kind of criteria (for example, for optimal efficiency).
-  If Tactical types assess their actions to be directed towards a
   concrete goal, when the goal is reached they feel a sensation of
   emptiness, disappointment.
-  Lexicon: in speech of tacticians words "way" "means" "methods" can
   often be heard. They are not inclined to speak of the purpose of
   their actions but rather substitute it with other concepts
   ("necessity" "dream" "interest" "task" and so on)

Strategy
~~~~~~~~

-  Strategic types focus their attention on a "point" they wish to
   reach, i.e. on the goal of their actions instead of the actions and
   events themselves.
-  Strategists, as a rule, do not fix their direction i.e. concrete
   actions the sequence of which leads to the goal. Thus, their
   "trajectory" by which they move towards fulfilling their goals can
   change.
-  They assess their actions and choices from the point of view of how
   closer they bring them to their desired objectives (goals). Being put
   before a choice, they reject those options that do not bring them
   closer.
-  In analyzing past, Strategists accentuate "key moments" (most
   significant stages) that led them to present point. They do not
   consider all versions of events as equivalent (they perceive the
   version that has actualized separately, by itself)
-  They consciously set goals and have difficulty scrapping them. May
   experience confusion if they are forced to change a goal. They
   experience satisfaction in achieving their set objectives (goals) and
   disappointment if they had to deviate away from it or could not
   achieve it.
-  Strategists consciously operate with goals. In situations where
   Strategists have several goals, they sort and arrange their goals
   into a hierarchy.
-  Without having a conscious goal, Strategists feel as if something is
   missing and their life is incomplete. They experience discomfort and
   feel disoriented.
-  Lexicon: in their speech Strategists often use words "goal" "aim" and
   other versions of this. Strategists clearly express their goals and
   purposes, precisely formulate and describe them, do not substitute
   them with other concepts unlike Tacticians.

**Notes**

The key element in understanding this group is the dichotomy of
"goal/purposemethod/pathway". The consciousness of the Strategist is to
a larger degree orientated towards the goal/purpose itself and not
towards the actions undertaken in process of achieving it, while the
consciousness of the Tactician is largely focused on the path i.e. the
actual actions ("steps") but not their end goal. This encompasses not
only the conscious activities of individuals, which decisions they
undertake, and so on, but also external circumstances, background
events, and other concurrent factors. On a general level it is possible
to speak about a difference in "reference points": either the course is
corrected in accordance to some fixed goal (Strategist) or the course
becomes fixed and goals become variable (Tactician).

**Hypotheses**

Tactical types feel disappointment upon reaching a goal in cases when
they had to deviate from their course. This is because the course or
pathway is more important for Tactical types than their goal. Thus, in
situations when their purpose came to the foreground before their
course, they experienced discomfort. This is further aggravated for
Rational Tacticals, who, by their nature, are inclined to plan their
actions, and feel great discomfort if their plans come apart. On the
other hand, a feeling of emptiness arises because when a goal has been
reached the course is interrupted. Tactical types feel as if the ground
temporarily leaves from under their feet. The sensation of confidence,
resoluteness that accompanies their normal mode of life disappears. When
they were "moving along their own path", everything was clear and easy.
Upon reaching a goal, even if it was a much desired one, Tactical types
lose their "string" and often do not know how to proceed further and
what to do next.

**Examples**

*Tacticians:* "To speak of global goals is difficult, a goal is several
localized tasks" "I do not see one big goal, but rather a chain of small
ones" "I pick up everything as I go along" "Long term goals... well I
reach them, but somehow it all occurs crookedly" "If I ever set an end
goal, I would have died! Such a thing does not exit for me" "There are
multiple goals at the end of each path that you take. I try to "catch"
them along the way" "My way, for a long time, was clear to me" "There
are many things that I could have done, but haven't" "There are many
ways in which my life could have unfolded. I could have lived in
different places, could have had other professions" "If I was another
person, everything could have been different" "When I look back and
think about the things that could have been, I see many crossroads. I
see myself, as I am living after taking a different turnin another
universe"

*Strategists:* "The point is not whether the goal is big or small, but
in being aware of it. The goal is clear, the course is undefined... I
don't always remember how I accomplish what I have in mind" "I was a
slave to my goal" "A goal constitutes the central point of
self-organization. I feel ashamed that some goals are left unfulfilled,
even if they are insignificant... if a goal was drawn you can't really
erase it" "A global goal is a comforting thought. If the criteria of a
course satisfies the criteria set by the goal, I will take it" "There
aren't any "distractions" along the way" "A person must have a goal in
life, otherwisewhat's the point?" "A huge list35 items of what I want
to accomplish in my life" "A person cannot always clearly state that
what he wishes to accomplish, but nevertheless they accomplish it...
minor questions I do not consider, I aim somewhere further than that"
"There are such moment in ones lifecardinal moments,where if I failed
to do something I wanted, it would not have been me... I always look
where it would have led me" "Every act leads somewhere" "There were many
"key moments". The important thing was how they shortened or prolonged
my movement towards the end point" "I keep track of "key moments" and
can list them one by one. I regret that because of lack of experience I
could not solve some problems effectively, and because of this it took
longer time for me to reach my goal... One way or another, I would have
reached the result that I wanted to reach."

Examples
--------

Interaction of of two strategic types taken from Vera Stratievskaya's
EII-LIE semi-duality description:

-  Both EII and LIE are also strategic types: if they instigate
   something, it will be something substantial and they won't stop
   halfway at achieving this goal. Partners-strategists simply put each
   other before the fact that something is already planned and requires
   realization and active participation of the other partner. They do so
   without carefully considering means and capabilities of the other and
   without receiving his or her advice and consent. They simply suddenly
   "saddle" their partner with an activity or assignment, which in
   itself makes each of them feel frustrated. In dual relations, their
   enduring, hard-working, tactical, sensing partners LSE and ESI, can
   usually handle these "assignments" and help them realize their goals
   and plans, through even their energy and strength don't last forever.
   However, in semi-dual relations these two pragmatic and overly
   optimistic intuitive types are quickly faced with a mutual rejection
   of such plans: who likes it when such important and effort intensive
   decisions are made over their heads, regardless of their opinion,
   without their consent?  "You want this  you take care of it. Don't
   count on me. I have intended to do something else today."

Interaction of of two strategic types SLI-EII:

-  I would ask her: "This weekend I'm planning to go to this
   presentation. Would you like to come along?" She (SLI) would respond
   with: "No, we have important plans for the weekend. Did you forget?
   Attend another time." Me: "Well what plans did we have?" Her: replies
   with something hazy. Then she would was just sit in and watch movies
   or chat online when the day came.

Theoretical properties of tactical and strategic types
------------------------------------------------------

Tactical/strategic corresponds with the
:ref:`inert <contact>`/ :ref:`contact <contact>` dichotomy for
:doc:`irrational <ration_irration>` :doc:`information elements <elements>`:

-  The tactical types have contact :doc:`sensing <sensing_intuition>` and inert :doc:`intuition <sensing_intuition>`.
-  The strategic types have contact intuition and inert sensing.
