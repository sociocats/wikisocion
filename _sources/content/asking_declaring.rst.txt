Asking and declaring
===============================

**Asking** / **Declaring**, sometimes called **Questim** / **Declatim**
or **Interrogative** / **Declarative**, is one of the 15 `Reinin dichotomies <reinin_dich>`.


Asking and declaring types
--------------------------

-  The asking :doc:`IM types <socionic_type>` are :doc:`LII <LII>`, :doc:`ILE <ILE>`,
   :doc:`EIE <EIE>`, :doc:`IEI <IEI>`, :doc:`ESI <ESI>`, :doc:`SEE <SEE>`,
   :doc:`LSE <LSE>`, :doc:`SLI <SLI>`.
-  The declaring :doc:`IM types <socionic_type>` are :doc:`ESE <ESE>`,
   :doc:`SEI <SEI>`, :doc:`LSI <LSI>`, :doc:`SLE <SLE>`, :doc:`LIE <LIE>`,
   :doc:`ILI <ILI>`, :doc:`EII <EII>`, :doc:`IEE <IEE>`.


Typical characteristics
-----------------------

Askers
~~~~~~

#. tendency to dialogue
#. much of what an asker says seems more question-like, even statements
#. always, as the other person talks, affirm the receipt of information
   with yeah, mhm, etc.
#. motive of communication is external
#. can talk to an audience as a whole very well
#. starts talking at times expecting someone to get interested and start
   paying attention
#. has a tendency to interrupt and feels comfortable pausing half way on
   the speech and with "questions allowed all the time" way, returning
   to what was said later if necessary
#. quite often asks a non-rhetorical question and answers it himself
#. often just asks questions to fill in time, without serious need to
   actually find the information asked

Declarers
~~~~~~~~~

#. tendency to monologue
#. much of what a declarer says seems more statement-like, even
   questions
#. listens attentively and silently to others' speeches to return to a
   long speech
#. motive of communication is internal
#. finds it easier to talk to one person at a time
#. before starting to talk, first ascertains that attention is grabbed
#. is very patient in terms of others speeches in terms of letting
   finish
#. prefers to finish the speech before letting others talk, likes
   closure and that their point was conveyed
#. questions are often either rhetorical or only strictly motivated by
   serious need for certain information

Extended characteristics
------------------------

Taken from :doc:`2003 study of Reinin traits <reinin_study>`.

Askers
~~~~~~

-  Asking types have a tendency to use interrogative intonations. Their
   statements sound far less categorical than those of declarers.
-  Asking types are inclined to answer a question with a question. Quite
   often they begin their story with phrases like "What should I tell
   you about?...". They often asks question that serve no purpose and
   require no answer ("Will you be there? - Who? I? I'll be there!") and
   repeat questions they've been asked even though they heard and fully
   understood them ("Will you be there? - Will I be there? Well...").
   Often they use questions as means to keep the conversation going (For
   instance they may ask questions just to buy time to think of the
   answers)
-  Askers, to a large degree, conduct communication in a form of a
   question and an answer. Always conducting dialogues with who ever
   they are talking to ("I would like to hear your response", "Ask me,
   I'll answer") or in imaginary conversations (internal "dialogue").
   Even if the story of the asker was planned as a monologue, as a rule
   it decomposes into fragments (question - answer) inevitably turning
   into a dialogue.
-  The asker quickly and at once reacts to a question set in the path of
   it's monologue (Independent of importance and
   rationality/irrationality of the question asked) ? answers the
   question then continues where they left off. As they are naturally
   prone to a dialogue style of communication over a "meek"(Unrequited)
   monologue mode, they prefer when they are asked questions when in
   monologue mode. Also because of that it takes great effort to stay on
   course and resist the temptation to stray of course by interrupting
   the interlocutor with questions that could possibly take them of
   course.

Declarers
~~~~~~~~~

-  When Declaring types speak they're inclined to use affirmative
   intonations and because of that they are often perceived as confident
   or as categorical. Even their questions are often relayed in an
   affirmative tone.
-  Declaring types are inclined to ask questions to receive/get answers
   to them. Unlike askers, they rarely answer a question with a question
   or ask questions that are conversational surplus or ask questions as
   a way to keep the conversation going.
-  Declarers are inclined to communicate in forms of monologues, where
   each party has "it's turn". Because of that they subconsciously
   attempt to transform a dialogue into a monologue (Either their own or
   that of their interlocutor by just listening without interrupting)
   and as a result of that the conversation ends up sounding like a
   sequence of two alternating monologues.
-  Declarers can lose their train of thought when they are interrupted
   with questions during their monologues and because of that they
   usually wait and respond to such questions later. When asked a
   question "on topic" they will usually asks the person who asked the
   question to be patient as they are getting to that or to wait till
   they are finished and will try to incorporate their answer into their
   monologue. They relate with greater understanding to the desire to
   not to be interrupted while they are speaking and because of that
   they avoid asking questions while their interlocutor is speaking even
   if they are "on topic" and prefer to ask questions and voice
   reciprocal arguments after their interlocutor has finished speaking.

**Analogy**

The asker and declarer difference can be explained by a parallel of
conducting narration in two different literary genres. For the declarer
it's a finished narration, the full story, you can see the beginning,
the culmination and the outcome, while the askers have more of a play
like mentality with constant exchanges between characters.

**Hypotheses**

#. The orientation of the primary function strengthens the manifestation
   of each of the attribute: extraversion emphasizes the declaring
   attribute while introversion emphasizes the asking attribute.
#. Nonverbal communication is more clearly expressed in the asker then
   in the declarer (eye contact, gestures).
#. In written speech declarers are more inclined to replace questions
   with a narrative on the question's essence, while askers are more
   inclined to replace narration with questions or exclamations (as if
   demanding an answer, provoking the reader to a response).

**Examples**

*Askers:* "Is there more then one way? Yes" (The person has fully
repeated the question they were asked) "Where to begin? Well, what would
you like to know? Yesterday I went..." (The response to a question "what
did you do yesterday" is with a series of questions practically removing
the significance of giving an answer)

*Declarers:* "When people list their interests I don't understand
whether it is with the intention to pursue the interests or what?" (The
question sounds like a statement) Declarer: Will you be there? Asker:
Who? I? Very well.

Additional Commentary and Notes
-------------------------------

See also: `Sociotypograph  determine your sociotype by Renin dichotomies <http://zhilkin.com/socio/en/>`_.

**Important note** Simple requests for information (i.e. asking
questions) should not be mistaken for socionics "Asking" Renin trait.
The name of this dichotomy should not be interpreted literally and
mistaken for questioning done for the purposes of learning,
clarifications, and gathering of additional information.

In particular, when people are studying socionics, they tend to bring up
many questions about any topics that are unclear to them. Posing such
questions for purposes of learning or clarification *does not* make them
"Asking" types. Declaring types will readily ask questions to obtain
information that they need, as this is a normal extent of lexical
operations and human behavior. Conversely, once a person is confident in
what they know, they will relay it in a more assertive and factual
manner; such solid grasp on material does not make them a "Declaring"
type.

Some citations illustrating how asking question *is not same* as Reinin
"Asking" trait on the example of type EII ("Declaring" type):

-  "But EII is one of the types who will ask a hundred questions before he goes and carries out what is needed of him." (:doc:`EII-LIE semi-duality <semi_dual_INFj_ENTj_vera>`)
-  "I like that they don't ask too many questions about everything, unlike our duals EIIs." (:doc:`ESI-LSE semi-duality <semi_dual_observations>`)

Since the Asking / Declaring dichotomy is very easily misinterpreted,
**it is inadvisable to use it in typing**.


Theoretical properties of asking and declaring types
----------------------------------------------------

-  Asking types are either judicious and logical, or decisive and
   ethical.
-  Declaring types are either decisive and logical, or judicious and
   ethical.
