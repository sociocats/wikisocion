Complementarity
====================

Complementarity is a corollary of duality as applied to elements, functions, and dichotomies, all of which describe how and why duals are the most compatible types. 

Complementary IM elements 
--------------------------------

Quadra values comprise two pairs of complementary elements, which must be either both valued or both subdued. 

* Ne and Si
* Ni and Se
* Fe and Ti
* Fi and Te

Complementary functions 
---------------------------

Function x in a type's Model A always contains the same element as function x +/- 4 in its dual's Model A. Thus the complementation of elements may be generalized to complementation of functions. 

* Leading and Suggestive
* Creative and Mobilizing
* Role and Ignoring
* Vulnerable and Demonstrative

Complementary dichotomies 
--------------------------------------

For any given dichotomy, one's dual has to have either the same or the opposite trait. Quadra values become a specific instance of this, due to the dichotomies of merriness and seriousness (Fe/Ti vs. Fi/Te) and judiciousness and decisiveness (Si/Ne vs. Se/Ni).
