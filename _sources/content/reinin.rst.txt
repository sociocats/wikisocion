Reinin, Grigoriy
====================

One of the most prominent socionics theorists of St. Petersburg
community. Suggested a number of interesting socionic hypotheses,
including the :doc:`Reinin dichotomies <reinin_dich>`. Has been
involved with socionics since 1984. Studied and later worked with the
author of socionics Aushra Avgustinavichute. Currently spends most of
his time attending to other interests that aren't related to socionics.
His website in Russian - `Studio of Grigoriy Reinin <http://www.grig.spb.ru/>`__. Reinin self-types as ILE, however,
several other socionists agree on ILI.

Contributions to Socionics
--------------------------

Grigoriy Reinin has met with A. Augusta in 1984 and they immediately
started to exchange letters. Reinin developed a theoretical basis for
the additional traits, while A. Augusta came up with the "filling" to

where his worked was first mentioned by A. Augusta under the name of
"Reinin traits".
