Judicious and decisive
===========================

**Judicious** / **Decisive**, also known as **Reasonable** /
**Resolute** or **Peripheral** / **Central**, is one of the 15 :doc:`Reinin dichotomies <reinin_dich>`.


Judicious and decisive types
----------------------------

-  Judicious types are all :doc:`Alpha <alpha_quadra>` and :doc:`Delta <delta_quadra>`
   types, namely, :doc:`LII <LII>`, :doc:`ESE <ESE>`, :doc:`SEI <SEI>`,
   :doc:`ILE <ILE>`, :doc:`EII <EII>`, :doc:`LSE <LSE>`, :doc:`SLI <SLI>`,
   :doc:`IEE <IEE>`.
-  Decisive types are all :doc:`Beta <beta_quadra>` and :doc:`Gamma <gamma_quadra>` types,
   namely, :doc:`LSI <LSI>`, :doc:`EIE <EIE>`, :doc:`IEI <IEI>`, :doc:`SLE <SLE>`,
   :doc:`ESI <ESI>`, :doc:`LIE <LIE>`, :doc:`ILI <ILI>`, :doc:`SEE <SEE>`.


Typical characteristics
-----------------------

Judicious
~~~~~~~~~

#. Natural state is relaxation.
#. Work best when they can relax beforehand, and are mobilized only for
   the duration necessary.
#. Have an easy time going from 'mobilized' to 'relaxed', but not from
   'relaxed' to 'mobilized'. Thus, they may need external stimuli to
   become mobilized.
#. Tend to divide up matters into smaller stages during which they are
   mobilized, relaxing between each stage.
#. Become aware of their own mobilization as soon as it manifests
   i.e., as soon as they start considering an action. However, they are
   often poorly aware of the periods of maximal mobilization  i.e., the
   time of action.
#. Focuses and places the most importance on the preparatory stage  the
   'action' stages are considered implicit and given less attention.
#. Consider their working conditions (e.g., comfort, freedom, and
   convenience) more important than the possible results and rewards
   (e.g., how much they are paid).
#. This attitude is strengthened by introversion.
#. More aware of when they are mobilized than when they are relaxed.
#. Consideration is very nice, that time during which you still don't
   have to make a decision. It's even better when it isn't necessary to
   do anything afterwards.

Decisive
~~~~~~~~

#. Natural state is readiness.
#. Work best if they are able to tart mobilizing in preparation for what
   they must do.
#. Easily go from 'relaxed' to 'mobilized', but not from 'mobilized' to
   'relaxed'. Thus, they may need external stimuli (like a movie) to
   relax.
#. Tend to perform an entire task at once, and to maintain their
   internal 'readiness' between tasks.
#. Become of aware of their own mobilization at its maximals  i.e.,
   when it is time for action. However, they are often poorly aware of
   when the mobilization firsts manifests  i.e., when they first start
   considering an action.
#. Focuses and places the most importance on taking action  preparation
   is considered implicit and given less attention.
#. Consider the possible results and rewards of their work (e.g., how
   much they are paid) more important than the working conditions (e.g.,
   comfort, freedom, and convenience).
#. This attitude is strengthened by extroversion.
#. More aware of when they are relaxed than when they are mobilized.
#. "I will not get stuck in the process of consideration  it always
   ends in a decision being made."


Extended characteristics
------------------------

Taken from :doc:`2003 study of Reinin traits <reinin_study>`.


Judicious
~~~~~~~~~

-  Judicious types are relaxed in their natural state; they mobilize and
   concentrate only when needing to accomplish some objective. After the
   task has been completed, they demobilize again. This state of
   demobilization is the natural state of the Judicious types.
-  For Judicious types, it is mandatory that before they engage in some
   important task, they spend some time in this natural state of
   "slackness" (relax and distract themselves)the better they rest, the
   better they will subsequently mobilize and concentrate at the crucial
   moments, and the better their overall performance will be. The more
   difficult the task ahead of themthe more crucial and necessary prior
   rest becomes.
-  A transition from a state of mobilization (high activity) to a state
   of slackness (low activity) for Judicious types does not present a
   problem. However, they can experience difficulties while trying to
   "mobilize" themselves (it is difficult for them to leave their
   natural state). Because of this, they often require some kind of
   stimulus to get mobilized (they are inclined to put themselves in
   situations where external factors either force them to act or someone
   else acts for them)
-  Judicious types tend to divide large tasks into several stages. Then
   they mobilize to carry out each stage, and in between revert back to
   their natural relaxed state (small matters they can do in a single
   push).
-  They become aware of their state of readiness when they have just
   begun considering taking action i.e. at the most minimal level or
   mobilization. They are poorly aware of moment they undertook some
   decision, often do not remember it.
-  Judicious types are better aware of the preparatory stage and
   consider it more valuable (this is the stage of discussion,
   presenting options, choosing between them, and so on). They invest
   more time and effort into this stage. Stages when oneself comes to a
   decision and executes it are as if impliedthey are considered less
   important and given less attention.
-  In regards to work, Judicious types appreciate a certain level of
   convenience, freedom, and comfort. Actual place of work (the
   environment in which they work) they are inclined to evaluate from
   the point of view of its conditions. Judicious types are not inclined
   to renounce their conveniencesthey are not ready to sacrifice their
   working conditions for the sake of the results (for instance a
   monetary reward) "Well I simply can't do without my peace!"
-  Speech peculiarities: Judicious types describe how and why they came
   to a certain decision, but do not highlight the moment when they
   undertook it; in conversations about work they speak of working
   conditions (convenience, breaks, proximity to their place of
   residence, and so on)

Decisive
~~~~~~~~

-  Decisive types will often mobilize before it is really necessary, as
   if they are subconsciously preparing for accomplishing upcoming
   tasks; after accomplishing a task Decisive types remain in a state of
   mobilization for some time afterwards. A state of readiness is their
   natural state.
-  It is necessary for Decisive types to stay in their natural sate of
   mobilization up until the end of an important taskthe more effective
   the mobilization, the more fulfilling their rest will be ("If you
   don't go to workyou cannot rest")
-  After completing the necessary task, Decisive types have trouble
   leaving their state of mobilization (frequently this is expressed by
   aimless, thoughtless activity). Therefore, Decisive types often
   require subsequent additional, external stimuli (for instance, they
   may plan a diversion: "After the test, I will certainly go see a
   movie") or turn to other people to help them relax and forget about
   their actual work.
-  Decisive types are not inclined to divide upcoming large tasks into
   separate stages. They will instead stay mobilized for the entire
   duration of the task so that the task could be accomplished as a
   whole. While the task is still unfinished, they maintain a state of
   internal readiness.
-  Decisive types become aware of their own state of mobilization at the
   moment they make a decision i.e. when the mobilization reaches a
   sufficiently high level. They are aware of the moment of they
   undertake a decision and remember it ("I have decided that...").
-  Decisive types better recognize the stage of their involvement,
   starting from the moment that they made a decision. They invest more
   time and effort into carrying out the task, since they consider the
   actual work to be the most important part. They appreciate far less
   and are far less aware of the preparation and planning stages than
   the subsequent decisions and their implementation.
-  Decisive types are inclined to work for the sake of the result (for
   example, a reward or bonus). In contrast to the Judicious types, they
   can renounce their comforts and conveniences for this. They evaluate
   their place of work by looking at what returns they get for the
   effort they invested (including monetary rewards).
-  Speech features: Decisive types underscore the moments of making a
   decision and in detail speak of stages of its implementation; in
   conversation about work they speak about its "fruits", decisions and
   results; in speech the word "money" is often heard.

**Notes**

The radical difference between Judicious and Decisive types is in the
development of the cycle "mobilizationactivityrelaxation" while
performing any difficult, critical task. The concept of "natural state"
does not refer to the whole process of existence of an individualit
refers only to a certain point in that cycle. The natural state of
Judicious types is relaxation, slackness; the natural state of Decisive
types is readiness, mobilization. Both types can distinguish between
these states through contrast and clearly differentiate between them.
They consciously leave their natural "base" state and "by force" bring
themselves into the required stateJudicious types become aware of their
state of mobilization, while Decisive types become aware of their state
of rest.

**Hypotheses**

#. For the Decisive sensing types, mobilization has something to do with
   sensingit is something physiological, a corporal condition
   (mobilization for them is perceived as bodily tension). Decisive
   intuitive types experience (and accordingly describe) a condition of
   mobilization that likened to internal readiness or inspiration. In a
   similar fashion, relaxation for Judicious sensing types is a physical
   sensation/conditionan absence of pressure and stress on the body.
   Judicious intuitive types primarily feel this certain rhythm, of
   alternation of opposite states. In other words, relaxation or
   slackness can be perceived as divergence of attention, while
   mobilization as focus, as convergence of attention.
#. Decisive types view decisions they undertook as their own, and
   circumstances as surrounding factors in making their choice.
   Judicious frequently view their decisions as something they were
   compelled or forced to undertake by the circumstances.
#. Judicious types better than Decisive can distribute their energy and
   estimate their reserves and expenditures, while Decisive types can
   maintain a high level of "charge" for prolonged periods of time.
#. Decisive types prefer following a "campaign" method in workwhen it's
   required (for example, for a large reward) work intensively for days
   and weeks, but then have time for rest and leisure. For the Judicious
   types "campaign" method of work is unnatural, they prefer to carry
   out work in "small portions".
#. Extrovert-introvert orientation strengthens the manifestation of this
   dichotomy: extroversion strengthens Decisiveness and introversion
   strengthens Judiciousness.

**Examples**

*Judicious:* "I don't study the day before a big exam. I go to take a
walk, read a little, etc." "I don't purposefully relax, but neither do I
stay up until 6 o'clock" "Everything is designed in such a manner that
after 10pm all is finished. I spend my evening as usual and why
interfere with that?" "If I'm very tiredI just rest however much is
necessary" "You should not work long on one problem, postpone it for
another time" "Dealing with the moment of making a decision is
complicated. It is not kept track of. The stage of preparation and the
act of deciding occurs automatically, what happens afterwards is not
related to it. Deciding is in itself an actionone can always return to
it" "Thinking things overthis is the real work, after which the act of
making the decision itself is not given attention. If it is necessary to
do something else... I can feel in the back of my mind the circumstances
that will force me to do it. I put myself into such situations" "There
is a primary selection: is this necessary or not necessary, and from
there things develop. The decision is somehow made, but in unconscious
manner, and even if it is accepted, that does not mean that I will get
around to it." "Consideration is very niceyou still don't need to
decide. It's even better if you don't have to anything afterwards."
"Before deciding on something, discussions are plentiful, but which
decisions are undertaken I cannot keep a track of." "I modeled it in
several versionsit is as if virtually I have already done it" "When
some task is assigned, I carefully consider it for a long time. There
isn't a conclusive moment for me when I finally decide to do something"
"The main thing in work is freedom of organization, freedom of choice"
"The opportunity to recharge is very important, I don't want to burn
out" "I need a comfortable workplace which would be solely mine."

*Decisive:* "First, lets make a push and do itthen we shall rest" "I
feel terribly frustrated when someone tries to distract or engage me
before an exam. Why? It messes with my concentration, to put it another
way, it messes with my "inspiration"" "Sometimes I get so tired that I
can't even sleep from the exhaustion." "I was writing my diploma for
there days straight, then I came home and just collapsed." "Making a
decision constitutes a separate moment, any doubts and fluctuations take
place before that." "I always keep track of what decision I make. Every
time I make a decision it's like a burden of responsibilities falls on
my shoulders." "I will not get stuck on the process of discussion and
consideration... it will be concluded with a decision." "If I decided
watch a movie, then I will watch it" "Naturally, I remember when I made
that choice" "When a person speaks of something, I perceive it as a
signal to action even if it was just a suggestion... The decision to act
is just an intermediate stage. If a decision is made, it does not mean
that something has been done" "I don't understandhave we decided on
something or not?" "Work should be interesting, but paymentthat is of
course considered." "I work for the money, I don't consider leisure a
part of it. I work as much as they pay me."
