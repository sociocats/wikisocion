The `International Institute of
Socionics <http://socionic.info/et/buklet.html>`__ was founded in Kiev,
Ukraine in 1991. It publishes a quarterly journal called *Socionics,
Mentology, and Personality Psychology* (in Russian only), as well as
four other journals. The Institute brings together nearly ten socionists
- each of whom is well-known in his own right. Three of them do
consulting work together - Dr. :doc:`Aleksandr Bukalov <bukalov>` (Director of the institute), Dr. Olga
Karpenko, and Dr. Galyna Chykyrysova. These members make frequent trips
around Russia, Germany, Ukraine and other countries to do management and
production consulting projects using "S-Technologies" - their name for
their socionic know-how and consulting methodology.

The institute is an officially registered organization. It hosts annual
international socionics conferences, publishes scientific journals
"Socionics, mentology and personality psychology", "Management and
Personnel: Psychology of management, Socionics and Sociology",
"Psychology and Socionics of interpersonal relations","Pedagogics,
Psychology and Socionics of Education".
