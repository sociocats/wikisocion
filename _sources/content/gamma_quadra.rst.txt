Gamma Quadra
====================

**Gamma**, or the 'third' :doc:`quadra <quadra>`, includes the types
:doc:`SEE <SEE>`, :doc:`ILI <ILI>`, :doc:`LIE <LIE>`, and :doc:`ESI <ESI>`.

The :doc:`Reinin traits <reinin_dich>` that distinguish Gamma from other
:doc:`quadras <quadra>` are ":doc:`decisive <judicious_decisive>`,"
":doc:`serious <merry_serious>`," and ":doc:`democratic <democratic_aristocratic>`."

Dominant elements
-----------------

The **dominant**\ :doc:`IM elements <elements>` of the Gamma Quadra are
**Te, Fi, Se, Ni** that correspond to symbols |symbol_p.gif|
|symbol_r.gif| |symbol_f.gif| |symbol_t.gif|, respectively. All Gamma
Quadra types have these elements in the :ref:`Ego <ego-block>` or
:ref:`Super-Id <superid-block>` blocks and tend to promote or favor their use
over subdued elements.

-  Gamma types take a longer-term view regarding efficiency and
   profitability, giving lower priority to the short term. Likewise,
   they tend to aim at the broader benefits of decisions, rather than
   only at those affecting themselves, giving them an inclination for
   self-sacrifice.
-  Gamma types like to talk about where present trends are leading in
   terms of potentially profitable events and undertakings.
-  Gamma types tend to give more value to ideas and concepts that are
   firmly connected to factual information.

Fi blocked with Se, |symbol_r.gif| |symbol_f.gif|

-  Gamma types take a hard-line approach regarding ethical principles
   and the punishment, even revenge, on those who break them.
-  Gamma types place high value on personal loyalty, once they feel a
   close relationship has been established.
-  Gamma types like to discuss personal relationships in a realistic
   manner and are skeptical that "jerks" can ever become "nice people",
   for instance.


Subdued elements
----------------

The **subdued**\ :doc:`IM elements <elements>` of the Gamma Quadra are
**Fe, Ti, Ne, Si** or |symbol_e.gif| |symbol_l.gif| |symbol_i.gif|
|symbol_s.gif| respectively. These elements reflect aspects of reality
which Gamma Quadra types prefer to keep to themselves and not discuss
openly.

-  Gamma types don't tend to form or maintain groups based on fun,
   emotional interaction, but only take groups seriously that perform
   some common productive activity or discuss serious topics.
-  Gamma types reject the idea that it's best to avoid confrontations so
   as not to spoil the mood of those present, they prefer directness in
   settling or at least discussing disagreements.
-  Gamma types have difficulty relating to emotional atmospheres
   connected to "special dates" such as public holidays.

Ti blocked with Ne, |symbol_l.gif| |symbol_i.gif|

-  Gamma types do not see much point in deeply analyzing ideas that they
   see as having little practical application or connection to reality.
-  Gamma types are more inclined to speculate and discuss possible
   developments of present circumstances, or how these came about, than
   to speculate or analyze alternative scenarios or possibilities

Group behavior
--------------

Groups made up of primarily Gamma types tend to be small in size;
perhaps 6 at most. Laughter and very obvious displays of emotion are
subdued, instead, there is a lot of smiling, amusement with ironic and
witty remarks or, when serious subjects or not very happy personal
experiences are discussed, a serious demeanour. Even such small groups
tend to split into smaller ones; perhaps 3 is the ideal "group" size for
Gammas.

Group discussions are focused on exchange of information and ideas on
subjects of mutual interest, discussing and planning activities
together, or on personal experiences. The latter are usually discussed
not with the purpose of making people laugh or to boast one's position
but to get an insight into the lessons to be drawn from such
experiences.

Gammas usually dislike being "drawn" into larger groups where loud
exchanges of jokes and quick shifting of one subject to the other are
the norm, as in a large dinner table in an informal environment,
especially if the group is also somewhat "artificial" as in work
colleagues or business partners where personal relationships weren't
really spontaneously formed. In such situations, Gammas will tend to
focus on the persons sitting immediately near them in order to engage
them in more individual conversations or will tend to remain mostly
silent, not really participating in the group atmosphere, making the
impression of being "introverts" in the everyday meaning of the term.

Once a group is formed, it tends to be wary for some time of
"newcomers", being neither exclusive nor inclusive on purpose.
Conversations often focus on trends regarding material and yet personal
issues, such as career prospects and developments, success or failure of
financial investments and enterprises, and the future prospects of
romantic relationships, as well as the reasons for the failure of past
ones. In more light-hearted moments, such talks get a "bawdy" flavor
with some slight teasing.

Other subjects tend to focus on internal work politics from the point of
view of how it jeopardizes general efficiency, the nonsense of
bureaucracy, and how to be better than competitors.

Romance styles
--------------

Gammas usually have little time for "romance" in the "wooing" meaning of
the term; relationships tend to develop rather as the meeting of two
individuals interested in a relationship and each other. Elements of
"courtship" or "romance" are seen as rituals with less meaning than the
feelings involved. Relationships, also friendships, usually develop from
exchanges of information, ideas, personal experiences of special
significance, and mutual help, proceeding to activities together.

Gamma romantic interactions tend to focus on the longer-term prospects
of the relationship in terms of definition, that is, for instance, even
if it is to be a temporary relationship, this should be more or less
clear, or at least in one's mind, from the beginning. General impatience
with flirting for flirting's sake, or for fun; approaches and moves are
made with a purpose, which may be altered down the road, nonetheless.
Assumption that sexual innuendo and approaches are backed by some sort
of emotional attachment. Once a relationship is established as being
romantic, interactions tend to focus on physical and somewhat tough
interplay and innuendo. Playful power-games, focusing on intensity of
interactions and feelings.

Perception of other quadras
---------------------------

Alpha
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Gammas tend to perceive Alpha types as creative, generally well-meaning,
and friendly and pleasant people, especially as a group, as a first
impression. Later, Gammas tend to see Alphas as lacking ambition in the
longer term, overly concerned with sensorial pleasure and comfort, and
overly demanding of, and sensitive to, external emotional expression
without making much effort to focus on deeper feelings involved.

Beta
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Gammas tend to regard Beta types as driven, ambitious people with a
sense of purpose and who can get things done, usually with very strong
views, as in political issues or ways of approaching work, which Gammas
tend to see as not backed by sufficient factual confirmation and
therefore too ideological. Gammas also may regard Betas as two-faced
when bent on achieving a goal, and too concerned with their social
status, and that of others, within any given social group.

Delta
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Gammas tend to perceive Delta types as kindly, well-meaning and creative
people, but perhaps too present-focused and lacking ambition with a
longer-term perspective, as well as being overly welcoming and forgiving
of people whom Gammas may regard as undeserving.
