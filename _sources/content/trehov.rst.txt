Alex wrote the following about himself on forums in January 2006:

   "Trehov Aleksei Vladimirovich. Became acquainted with socionics
   accidentally in summer 2001. Rather soon my theoretical reflections
   turned into articles. The list of my publications can be viewed.
   However, my socionics maturity I count from the moment I've read
   articles about Reinin traits for aspects and TIMs. Although I am also
   proud of a somewhat earlier article on "Questim" groups: despite the
   numerous works of V. Gulenko, I have managed to find small groups
   that have not been described by him or A. Aushra. Perhaps another
   good result can be considered expansion of model of IM for quadra to
   a full model, seven years after A. Bukalov proposed the mental ring.
   The role of the manager of socionics has attracted me more than the
   role of a theoretician, which led to the creation of "Black Squirrel"
   and Socionics Research Society. Nevertheless, I have not abandoned
   theoretical activities. In May 2006, I wrote an article about
   individual and socion aspects in traits of Reinin-Aushra."
