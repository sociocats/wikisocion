ESI-ESE Contrary Relations
--------------------------

Friendship between people of these types is common. It begins almost
immediately. After discussing all the mundane sensory topics in a circle
of mutual friends (where can one get something at a discount, what's the
best recipe for cooking a chicken) some part of the conversation will be
dedicated to the more intimate, personal topics. Once both the ESI and
the ESE open up before each other and talk about what is happening in
their personal lives, then it is quite possible that they will strike up
a friendship. If the ESI hasn't stopped communicating with the ESE after
hearing about the details of his or her personal life, then it may be
said that ESE's actions have been approved of, which is affirming and
pleasant for the ESE. ESI talks about the details of his private life
only with his close friends, and even then, if they are lucky, so if
this 'luck' has befallen to the ESE it is a significant gesture.

Their friendship is usually even-tempered with many exciting meetings.
ESE likes that the ESI is always balanced, diplomatic, and that he
clearly knows where he stands and about how to conduct his life. ESI
enjoys the 'brightness' of ESE, his extraversion and optimism, his
active (perhaps brave) and open approach to life by which he draws out
his introverted friend.

Most of the topics of their conversation center around the topic of
relationships, starting from their personal liaisons and romances to
what is happening in their family and close circle of friends. Both of
them are interested in learning about of what can happen, hoping that
another's experience can help them make better decisions in life.

However if they spend a lot of time together, the differences in their
ways of relating and evaluating relationships become clear. ESI holds on
to his principles and frameworks of behavior, to his internal sense of
correctness, while ESE behaves as he sees fit in the on-going situation.
ESE begins to feel tired of having to convince his negativist ESI friend
that everything will be alright, more so that ESI doesn't easily accept
his persuasions, since he is awaiting for Te+Ni argumentation of his
dual which the ESE cannot provide. Meanwhile ESI doesn't feel
comfortable to be always exposed to public, as the ESE draws him out
into uncomfortable for him atmosphere. ESI also finds fault with the
superficial, as it seems to him, and short-sighted approach to life of
his friend.

Time passes and these grievances are forgotten. New meeting brings new
joy into their lives. So many stories need to be told, so many news need
to be exchanged, so many questions asked. Both of them await to hear
each other's advice concerning each other's stories.
