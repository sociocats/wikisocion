Common biases in socionics
======================================

One of the challenges in creating objective statements about Socionics
is that the very nature of the field invites the potential for bias. For
a simple demonstration, consider someone trying to ascertain another
persons strong :doc:`IM elements <elements>` by asking "What do you
think you can do better than everybody else?" The question itself
reflects a competitive nature, which may not be equally shared by all
people. Furthermore, it is likely that some types would phrase this
question differently from others; and similarly, some socionic types
would have an easier time responding to the question when phrased that
way.

Categories of potential causes for systemic biases in socionics include
those shown in the table of contents below.



Type, quadra, or dichotomy-centric biases
-----------------------------------------

Work by socionics theorists of a particular type or quadra may be
subject to point-of-view biases inherent to their own type or
:doc:`quadra <quadra>`. For example, because :doc:`Augusta <augusta>` and
other prominent :doc:`Socionists <socionist>` are from the
:doc:`Alpha <alpha_quadra>` quadra, their work has sometimes been suspected of
reflecting an Alpha bias. Likewise, :doc:`Vera Stratievskaya <vera>`'s type descriptions are in turn
sometimes suspected of reflecting a :doc:`Gamma <gamma_quadra>` bias since her own
type is :doc:`ESI <ESI>`.



Alpha-centrism
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An example of possible Alpha bias is that descriptions of |symbol_l.gif|
and |symbol_i.gif| are often described in what seem to some people to be
broader, more encompassing terms than the :doc:`IM elements <elements>`
of :doc:`Gamma <gamma_quadra>`, being the opposing quadra. For example
|symbol_l.gif| is sometimes described as related to the use of logic and
understanding, as well as organization, whereas |symbol_p.gif| is often
described enigmatically as related to "business logic" or random,
disconnected facts.



|symbol_i.gif| bias
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Similarly, |symbol_i.gif| is often described as relating to ideas,
insight, and intellectual interest in general, whereas |symbol_t.gif| is
often described more enigmatically as related to "time." It is very
likely :doc:`Augusta <augusta>` increased the territory of |symbol_i.gif|
in comparison to other :doc:`IM elements <elements>` to reflect the most
outstanding qualities of herself and other :doc:`ILEs <ILE>` around her.
For example, here are a few lines about leading |symbol_i.gif| from her
work *The Socion, or Socionics Basics*:

   "When this element is in the leading position, the individual has
   pronounced cognitive interests. He is constantly studying underlying
   phenomena, which he is able to communicate to others quite
   successfully by making complicated things simple. Likes to explain to
   others his understanding of things. In favorable conditions becomes a
   scientist or writer"
   `1 <http://www.socionics.us/works/socion2.shtml>`

The rest of the description is probably objective, but this section
above would apply to many people of other types with pronounced
intellectual interests. Over time this bias seems to have weakened in
Russian socionics, and statements such as Augusta's are now rare among
publishing socionists. However, in forums and informal discussions they
are sometimes brought up by amateurs who have picked up the bias from
socionics literature.



ILE bias
~~~~~~~~

The :doc:`ILE <ILE>` bias comes from :doc:`Augusta <augusta>` herself and is
closely related to the one above. According to Augusta's original
conception of type roles, :doc:`ILEs <ILE>` were seen as being a type that
sees the hidden roots of phenomena (supposedly |symbol_i.gif|) and
arranges them into a system or theory (|symbol_l.gif|). For many years
:doc:`Augusta <augusta>` and her associates assumed that scientists and
thinkers who generated new theories were :doc:`ILEs <ILE>` (people like
Einstein, Bohr,
Newton, and Darwin). Later,
she and others seemed to recognize this mistake, but the ILE bias has
still not been completely undone. Just as "health" does not equate
exactly to |symbol_s.gif|, "theory" does not equate exactly to
|symbol_l.gif|, and people of different types may tend to generate
theories of a slightly different nature.



Intuitive bias
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In popular socionics, intellectual inquisitiveness and a focus on "the
big picture" is often associated with :doc:`intuition <sensing_intuition>`, while
:doc:`sensing <sensing_intuition>` is associated with a "focus on details" or a
preoccupation with "the here and now." While such a division may appear
to be true for many or most people, intellectual sensers may not
identify with the image presented by some descriptions of
:doc:`sensing <sensing_intuition>`. Such popular descriptions add attributes shared
by most or all highly :doc:`intelligent <intelligence>` people to the
"intuitive" category, leading to possible systematic :doc:`typing <diagnosis>`
errors.



Misinterpreting the behavior of other types
-------------------------------------------

This category is similar to type- or quadra-related bias. However, here,
the issue is that in describing a given type, one may notice behaviors
that appear foreign. Hence, one's description of a given type may
reflect how odd or mysterious that type seems to oneself.

**Examples** One possible example is the common assertion that ILIs are
predisposed against new ideas because of their being new. A number of
factors may create this impression from the perspective of other types,
such as that ILIs may:

-  View criticism as being an important form of contribution, which may
   have the effect of making it seem that they don't like the idea
   they're criticizing
-  Tend not to display enthusiasm to the degree of other types (because
   of :ref:`subdued <valued>` :doc:`Fe <Fe>`)
-  Not want their primary role to be in the area of practical
   implementation, including implementation of other people's ideas
-  Take too little initiative in promoting their own ideas
-  Be perfectionistic about their own ideas and therefore resentful when
   people with less honed ideas get more attention for them

A combination of these factors may cause ILIs to seem predisposed
against new ideas when that may not necessarily be the case.



National and cultural biases
----------------------------

Cultural differences in overall demeanor, norms, and the ways people
express themselves may influence type descriptions.

| **Russian vs. Western views**
| Competing typologies, such as the :doc:`MBTI <MBTI>` theory, which
  developed in the U.S. are sometimes described by Russian Socionists as
  too optimistic, showing too little of the dark side of the various
  types. In contrast, people from the West may be surprised by the
  degree to which Socionics types are described as melancholic. This
  difference may reflect differences in the degree to which people in
  different cultures tend to express melancholy, morose, pensive
  characteristics in public--or, on the contrary, the degree to which
  they are conditioned by their culture to express bright, optimistic
  qualities. In addition, socionics types's "weaknesses" as perceived by
  other types, usually reflecting the super-ego functions, are a central
  part of the socionics conception of types, while :doc:`MBTI <MBTI>`
  descriptions tend to focus only on each type's "strengths", an
  approach that Russian socionists tend to see as too "politically
  correct" and avoiding of a frank discussion of the types.



Passing on descriptive elements without fully knowing their source
------------------------------------------------------------------

Many type descriptions contain similar phrases about very specific
behaviors that have no connection to the position of
:doc:`functions <functions>` in :doc:`Model A <model_a>`. A famous example is
a phrase from :doc:`Weisband's <weisband>` early descriptions that
:doc:`LIEs <LIE>` are "inclined towards alpinism." If these don't reference
specific studies supporting them, then it becomes very difficult to
ascertain the validity of such statements. Potentially, an observation
made on a small number of people may get copied from description to
description and hence become "standard" in type descriptions (or
descriptions of other groupings), hence perpetuating a somewhat biased
understanding. Collective discussion and criticism lessens the frequency
of these "random" tidbits.



Associating specific interests and topic areas with types
---------------------------------------------------------

A kind of bias related to the other categories comes from describing
types, quadras, and IM elements in terms of specific interests and topic
areas. For example, a person might associate interest in the arts with
being an ethical type, interest in pure sciences with being an Alpha NT,
and interest in applied sciences with being a Gamma NT. While some
people regard these socionic "stereotypes" as completely valid, others
point out that they're also inaccurate for a number of people.

One problem with this kind of type-interest linkage is that it fails to
take into account the roles other IM elements may play within in a
particular interest. For example, it is commonly suggested that an
interest in health is related to |symbol_s.gif|. However, when one
thinks of the breadth of activities that may be related to health, it
becomes apparent that many different functions might be involved:

-  Gathering and analyzing the latest research on nutrition
-  Predicting global trends related to world health
-  Coming up with innovative solutions to health problems
-  Developing formulas for maintaining good health
-  Fostering relationships for good psychological health
-  Using spiritual or emotional means to influence physiological health

By considering the breadth of what's involved in "health," it becomes
clear that more IM elements than |symbol_s.gif| may be involved.



Describing socionic categories using language that is foreign to that category
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The authors of :doc:`The Semantics of the Information Aspects <semantic_aspects>` found that many
existing descriptions of :doc:`information aspects <information_aspect>`
used language that did not resonate with the aspects themselves. For
example, many descriptions of |symbol_t.gif| contain the word
"mysticism," which did not resonate with individuals with |symbol_t.gif|
as a strong function. "Mysticism" was an external interpretation of the
interests and behaviors of types with strong |symbol_t.gif|, but was not
how these types themselves perceived things.

Other examples may be when sensers are described as being "focused only
on the here and now," or intuiters as being "impractical." The first
sounds like something an intuitive type would say about sensers, while
the second sounds like what a sensing type might think about many
intuiters.

It could be argued that describing Socionics categories from the
perspective of how those of an opposing category may describe them is
legitimate, valuable information. The bias comes if this isn't done
evenly for every category (i.e., if some categories are described from
an internal viewpoint, and others from a more external viewpoint).
Research on how people of different categories describe themselves and
are described by people of other categories, and clearly annotated
information based on such research, may help in overcoming such bias.



Over-emphasis on duality and intra-quadra relationships
-------------------------------------------------------

Because Socionics was developed largely to understand behavior in
long-term personal relationships, the benefits of certain relationships
in other settings may be overlooked. For example, the impression is
created that relations between :doc:`opposing quadras <quadra>`
are adversarial; however, in many settings these relations may be more
agreeable than predicted (especially :doc:`Contrary <extinguishment>` and
:doc:`Super-Ego relations <superego>`). In an atmosphere that
emphasizes purely intellectual discussion and doesn't require emotional
or practical support, :doc:`Alpha <alpha_quadra>` and :doc:`Gamma <gamma_quadra>` NT types
may find a certain complementarity.

:doc:`Duality <duality>` is emphasized in Socionics because it involves
complementarity at all levels. However, other relationships have their
own merits.
