Club
===============

**Clubs** is a :doc:`small groups <small_groups>` of four types that share
the same two traits on the :doc:`intuition <sensing_intuition>` /
:doc:`sensing <sensing_intuition>` and :doc:`logic <ethics_logic>` / :doc:`ethics <ethics_logic>`
dichotomies. They are also often called "occupational attitudes"
(*установки на род деятельности* - :doc:`Gulenko's <gulenko>` term).
:doc:`Augusta <augusta>` and :doc:`Reinin <reinin>` were the first to apply
this concept. There are four clubs in the :doc:`socion <socion>`:

-  :doc:`Humanitarians <club_humanitarians>`: intuitive and ethical (NF), or :doc:`IEE <IEE>`, :doc:`IEI <IEI>`, :doc:`EIE <EIE>`, and :doc:`EII <EII>`.
-  :doc:`Socials <club_socials>`: sensing and ethical (SF), or :doc:`SEE <SEE>`, :doc:`SEI <SEI>`, :doc:`ESE <ESE>`, and :doc:`ESI <ESI>`.
-  :doc:`Pragmatists <club_pragmatists>`: sensing and logical (ST), or :doc:`SLE <SLE>`, :doc:`SLI <SLI>`, :doc:`LSE <LSE>`, and :doc:`LSI <LSI>`.
-  :doc:`Researchers <club_researchers>`: intuitive and logical (NT), or :doc:`ILE <ILE>`, :doc:`ILI <ILI>`, :doc:`LIE <LIE>`, and :doc:`LII <LII>`.

The same four :doc:`relations <intertype>` exist between the
types of any club: :doc:`identity <identity>`, :doc:`mirror <mirror>`,
:doc:`extinguishment/contrary <extinguishment>`, and
:doc:`quasi-identity <quasi_identity>`.

Clubs are often a common nucleus of spontaneous social interaction (as
opposed to "non-spontaneous" as in work, study etc) in modern western
societies, and therefore a very common point of formation for social
groups, more so than quadras since spontaneous social interaction with
new acquaintances tends to be based on common activities and interests
if not based on extension of one's close social circle, where quadras
are more relevant.

What leads to club-based groups, however, are merely the common
interests and activities; the clubs tend to cease to function as any
unit as soon as the interactions between their members move beyond those
common interests and activities, when the quadra interactions will
naturally take over.

Within the same quadra, Mirrors and Identicals belong to the same club.
This explains the high percentage of Mirror couples.
