Pavel wrote about himself on forums in January 2006:

   "Tsypin Pavel Evgenevich. Of socionics I first learned in 1998 from a
   book of P. Maksimov "Practical Astrology of Relationships" which
   contained a brief introduction to socionics. I became interested,
   tried typing myself (there were two options). Became acquainted with
   literature and people who were also interested in socionics;
   determined my own type. In 2002-2003 attended seminars given by
   Tatiana Menshov. In 2002 published first articles in the journal
   "Socionics, Mentolog, and Psychology of Personality". Main areas of
   interest in socionics: improvement and development of the theory in
   close contact with its practical application; methodologies of
   typing, intertype relations, quadral patterns. At current time, I am
   working in a staffing agency and have opportunities to check
   socionics theory and existing methologies in practice. Up to date,
   published 4 books (with publishing group "Black Squirrel") and 15
   articles (in journals SPiMO, SMiPL, "Management and quadra"). My role
   in socionics as I see it is in doing research, practical
   verification, and spreading obtained information to all people who
   are interested in it by means of books and articles. In terms of
   research, it is remarkable to work together with Aleksei Trehov. We
   have the same socionics with him - this is a rare case. The main
   prospect for socionics research in the future I see in the field of
   HR consulting."
