Meged and Ovcharov
========================

Valentina Meged and Anatoliy Ovcharov are socionists from Kiev, Ukraine
and a married couple (:doc:`IEE <IEE>` and :doc:`SLI <SLI>`, respectively).
They are known in the English socionics community for their
:doc:`subtype <subtype>` descriptions. Their views used to be quite
mainstream, but since the mid-90s their typing paradigm has shifted
dramatically, perhaps as a result of their close collaboration with
:doc:`Viktor Gulenko <gulenko>`, whose views changed at this time
also. In particular, since then they have changed many of their typings
of famous people to the point that virtually all of them are either
:doc:`EIE <EIE>` or :doc:`ILE <ILE>`. They have built a theory to support
this, saying that these two types are most critical to societal progress
the ILE for technical progress and the EIE for humanitarian progress.
The EIE is the next type down the ring of :doc:`benefit <benefit>` from
ILE. Many types they now see as being too meek to compete in the
rough-and-tumble world of public life. Also, their view that all acting
requires strong , and thus most actors are EIEs, has been strongly
criticized by other socionists. Today Meged and Ovcharov have lost much
influence in the socionics community.

About their first introduction to socionics: "We were first introduced
to it on a lecture delivered by Igor Weisband in Kiev House of
Scientists, where we were invited by a mutual friend, and then continued
in the club Socionics in Kiev House of Teachers in the beginning of
\1988. There we attended classes held by Victor Gulenko and Alexander
Bukalov."
