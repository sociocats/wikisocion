Oldham styles
=====================

`John M.
Oldham <http://www.forensicpanel.com/members/john_oldham_md.htm>`_,
M.D. is a professional psychiatrist renowned for his work on personality
disorders. Based on them, he proposed that healthy people have 16
personality styles, and the likeliest personality disorder they are
prone to eventually develop is correlated to which of the 16 is the most
predominant.

Since it is concerned with how healthy persons of different types become
psychologically unhealthy along different paths, it has similarities
with the :doc:`Enneagram of Personality <e9>` but
probably backed by more concrete empirical observations. Attempts have
been made to correlate his personality styles with the types of other
theories as in this
`site <http://www.geocities.com/lifexplore/oldham.htm>`_.

His personality styles are:

-  Adventurous
-  Aggressive
-  Artistic
-  Conscientious
-  Devoted
-  Dramatic
-  Idiosyncratic
-  Inventive
-  Leisurely
-  Mercurial
-  Self-Confident
-  Self-Sacrificing
-  Sensitive
-  Serious
-  Solitary
-  Vigilant



Correlation to socionics types
------------------------------

On occasion suggestions have been made about possible correlations
between Oldham's styles and the 16 socionics types, for example the
original creator of :doc:`The16types.info <the16types>`. This is
perhaps a possibility worth investigating, since psychiatric statistics
of the frequence of the relevant disorder might say something about the
distribution of the socionics types.

This approach would present some difficulties, though. For example, a
superficial reading of brief descriptions of Oldham's styles suggests
the following:

-  :doc:`SLE <SLE>` seems to be the best fit for three styles: Adventurous,
   Aggressive, and Self-Confident.
-  :doc:`SEI <SEI>` is the best fit for Artistic.
-  all logical introverts, and especially logical
   :doc:`IJs <IJ>`, can fit Solitary.
-  :doc:`LSE <LSE>`, :doc:`ESI <ESI>` and :doc:`LSI <LSI>` could fit
   Conscientious.
-  :doc:`SEI <SEI>` and :doc:`ESE <ESE>` fit Devoted best.
-  :doc:`EIE <EIE>` is the best fit for Dramatic.
-  :doc:`ILI <ILI>`, :doc:`IEI <IEI>` and perhaps :doc:`LII <LII>` fit
   Idiosyncratic best.
-  :doc:`ILE <ILE>` and :doc:`IEE <IEE>` fit Inventive best.
-  :doc:`SLI <SLI>` is the best match for Leisurely.
-  :doc:`SEE <SEE>` and :doc:`SEI <SEI>` fit Mercurial partly, but not very
   well.
-  :doc:`EII <EII>` is perhaps a match for Self-sacrificing in some
   situations.
-  :doc:`LIE <LIE>` might be one match for Vigilant.
