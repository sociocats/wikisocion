Ethics and logic
======================

**Ethics** / **logic** is one of the 4 :doc:`Jungian dichotomies <jungian>`, and also one of the 15 :doc:`Reinin dichotomies <reinin_dich>`. **Ethics** in socionics is a
perceptual quality defined by a focus on the human, social, moral, and
emotional content of reality. In contrast, **logic** entails a focus on
the inanimate, measurable, systemic, and procedural content of reality.

Ethical and Logical Types
-------------------------

**Ethical types** are: :doc:`SEI <SEI>`, :doc:`ESE <ESE>`, :doc:`EIE <EIE>`,
:doc:`IEI <IEI>`, :doc:`SEE <SEE>`, :doc:`ESI <ESI>`, :doc:`EII <EII>`, and
:doc:`IEE <IEE>`.

**Logical types** are: :doc:`ILE <ILE>`, :doc:`LII <LII>`, :doc:`LSI <LSI>`,
:doc:`SLE <SLE>`, :doc:`ILI <ILI>`, :doc:`LIE <LIE>`, :doc:`LSE <LSE>`, and
:doc:`SLI <SLI>`.

Nomenclature
------------

In :doc:`three-letter type codes <type_names>`, "Ethical" types have E as either the first letter, if ethics is their :ref:`leading function <leading-func>` (ESE, ESI), or as the second letter if ethics is their :ref:`creative function <creative-func>` (SEE, IEI); "Logical types have L as either the first or the second letter, depending on where in ego block their logical element is located.

| In :doc:`four-letter type codes <type_names>`, "Ethical" types have an F (feeling) as the third letter, and "Logical" types have T (thinking) as the third letter (e.g. ISFp, ISTj)

Theoretical properties of ethical and logical types
---------------------------------------------------

In socionics, two :doc:`information (IM) elements <elements>` denote
ethics - Fe |symbol_e.gif| and Fi |symbol_r.gif|, and two denote logic -
Te |symbol_p.gif| and Ti |symbol_l.gif|.

:doc:`Socionic types <socionic_type>` that have ethical elements in
:doc:`functions <functions>` 1,7 and 2,8 are called **Ethical types**.
Types that have logical elements in these functions are called **Logical
types**.


Description of the psychic functions
------------------------------------

Ethics
~~~~~~

**Ethics** is a mental process (or 'psychic function') that involves
focusing on emotional experience, human relationships, and subjective
attitudes. Ethics comes in two varieties (:doc:`extraverted <extroverted>`
and :doc:`introverted <introverted>`) depending on whether attention is
focused on reality outside the subject or on the subject's impressions
of reality.

Half of the :doc:`socion <socion>` consists of **ethical** types. These
types have either :doc:`introverted <Fi>` or
:doc:`extraverted <Fe>` ethics in their :ref:`Ego block <ego-block>`
(the first two :doc:`functions <functions>`).

Logic
~~~~~

**Logic** is a mental process (or 'psychic function') that involves
focusing on inanimate objects, logical relationships, and objective
truth. Logic comes in two varieties (:doc:`extraverted <extroverted>` and
:doc:`introverted <introverted>`) depending on whether attention is focused
on reality outside the subject or on the subject's impressions of
reality.

Half of the :doc:`socion <socion>` consists of **logical** types. These
types have either :doc:`introverted <Ti>` or
:doc:`extraverted <Te>` logic in their :ref:`Ego block <ego-block>`
(the first two :doc:`functions <functions>`).

Typical characteristics of ethical and logical types
----------------------------------------------------

Ethical types
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. In their thoughts and interactions, give greater weight to ethical
   factors.
#. Rather talk about ethical evaluations ("good or bad").
#. Frequently better at solving interpersonal problems.
#. More often have problems with finding logical solutions.
#. Tend to prefer persuasion over argumentation.
#. More vulnerable to "logical" manipulation.

Logical types
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. More often make decisions based on logical reasons.
#. Rather talk about logical evaluations ("right or wrong").
#. Frequently interested in systems, structures and patterns.
#. More often have interpersonal problems.
#. Tend to prefer argumentation over persuasion.
#. More vulnerable to "ethical" manipulation.

Ethics-Logic and Gender
-----------------------

Generally, most socionists claim that logical types are more common
among men, and ethical types among women. The ratios suggested are
generally between 55%-45% and 70%-30%. Others maintain that the
distribution is more or less balanced.

In addition, socionists note that logical women tend to be more
emotional than logical men, and ethical men less openly emotional than
women.

It is sometimes suggested that this disparity has a biological basis;
namely, that women are biologically adapted to bear, rear, and educate
children and to cooperate with others, which are ethics are a suitable
tool. Men, however, are biologically inclined to procuring food,
organizing work activities and hierarchies, and competing with others,
in which logic often plays a greater role.

The association with women as openly emotional and men as less so is
also subject to the influence of cultural stereotypes.
