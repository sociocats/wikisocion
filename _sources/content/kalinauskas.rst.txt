Kalinauskas, Igor
==============================

`Igor Nikolaevich
Kalinauskas <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Igor_Kalinauskas>`__ (real
last name Nikolaev) was one of the early socionists and associates of
:doc:`Aushra Augusta <augusta>` who is most known for developing a clear
and simple model of the psyche based on four functions rather than eight
as in :doc:`Model A <model_a>`. This model was known as the `"steering
wheel of Kalinauskas" <http://www.socionics.com/advan/wheel.html>`__ (in
Russian "shturval of Kalinauskas") due to its semblance to a round
steering wheel of a ship. This simple prototypical four-function model
was used by a number of early socionists as introductory material for
socionics study and research, but is much less popular today than :doc:`Model A <model_a>`, which was developed later. Outside of socionics
Kalinauskas has had a diverse career and is best known as a theater
director and an esoteric philosopher. Self-typing is ILE.
