Beta Quadra
====================

**Beta**, or the 'second' :doc:`quadra <quadra>`, includes :doc:`EIE <EIE>`,
:doc:`LSI <LSI>`, :doc:`SLE <SLE>`, and :doc:`IEI <IEI>`.

According to the :doc:`Reinin dichotomies <reinin_dich>`, Beta
Quadra is ':doc:`Decisive <judicious_decisive>`,' ':doc:`Merry <merry_serious>`,' and
':doc:`Aristocratic <democratic_aristocratic>`.'


Dominant elements
-----------------

The **dominant** :doc:`IM elements <elements>` of the Beta Quadra are
**Ti, Fe, Ni, Se** that correspond to symbols |symbol_l.gif|
|symbol_e.gif| |symbol_t.gif| |symbol_f.gif|, respectively. All Beta
Quadra types have these elements in the :ref:`Ego <ego-block>` or
:ref:`Super-Id <superid-block>` blocks and tend to promote or favor their use
over subdued elements.

-  Beta quadra types prefer situations where the power structure and
   hierarchy is clearly defined according to consistent rules where
   ambiguities are minimized.
-  Beta quadra types are more confident analysing realistic
   characteristics of situations, people, and objects, rather than
   alternative and could-it-be scenarios.
-  Beta quadra types are inclined to attribute to a new acquaintance
   traits that they have previously observed in other individuals
   belonging to the same group as they see the new acquaintance as
   belonging to (Aristocracy).
-  Beta quadra types are inclined to look for general rules explaining
   people, politics, mechanisms and trends, rules that once defined can
   be applied generally, rather than go about things in a case-by-case
   way.
-  Beta quadra types are energized by competitive situations where
   analytical tactics are emphasized.

Fe blocked with Ni, |symbol_e.gif| |symbol_t.gif|

-  Beta types tend to enjoy group activities where the whole group
   participates in generating a common emotional atmosphere, as in
   laughing at jokes, etc.
-  Beta types tend to feel energized in the presence of people who share
   their beliefs and express them with obvious enthusiasm and emotion.
-  Beta types tend to give more value to feelings when they are
   demonstrated with clear emotional expression, and tend to increase
   the level of their own emotional expression in order to get a
   reaction from other people.
-  Beta types tend to describe personal views of special meaning with
   "poetic" or "dramatic" expressions and language.
-  Beta types are often deeply concerned about social issues and the
   direction the world is heading. They believe that apathy is a
   significant cause of societal problems, and work to fight against it.

Subdued elements
----------------

The **subdued**\ :doc:`IM elements <elements>` of the Beta Quadra are
**Fi, Te, Si, Ne** that correspond to symbols |symbol_r.gif|
|symbol_p.gif| |symbol_s.gif| |symbol_i.gif|, respectively. These
elements reflect aspects of reality which Beta Quadra types prefer to
keep to themselves and not discuss openly.

Fi blocked with Ne, |symbol_r.gif| |symbol_i.gif|

-  Beta types are not inclined to enjoy discussions of personal
   experiences when the focus is on a person's own inner feelings,
   especially when described in a subdued way.
-  Beta types tend to be skeptical of another individual's potential for
   personal growth in terms of abilities and character, and dislike
   being the subject of such a discussion by others about themselves.

Te blocked with Si, |symbol_p.gif| |symbol_s.gif|

-  Beta types tend to look down on nuts-and-bolts, detailed work as a
   source of success, preferring to focus on "vision" and leadership.
-  Beta types don't so much enjoy relaxed personal activities as they do
   competitive group activities.

Group behavior
--------------

Preference for larger groups where participation is "collective" rather
than focused on individuals for any length of time, but with likely
"domination" by more assertive individuals. This means that beta groups
discuss topics that everyone could contribute to. Frequent unexplained
inside jokes are considered impolite because they exclude other people.
Jokes are loud and general, often about stereotypes. Betas attempt to
draw others into the group activity: for example, in a situation where
there are "group rituals" going on (as in drinking, dancing, etc), there
is good-natured pressure on "outsiders" to also participate in them,
with a sort of puzzled dismay if they prefer not to. They also try to
draw attention to people who might otherwise feel left out - usually
this is done with general jokes directed at individuals. In more subdued
moments, discussion of ideas involving present trends and political
implications, with strong views voiced. Personal experiences tend to be
discussed from the point of view of their external impact rather than
the individual's own personal view of them.

When larger social events are organized by Betas (such as parties,
receptions etc), they show an inclination to promote activities that
will lead to the guests involved as a single group, such as games and
shows; dislike for the "quieter" form of events where guests tend to
quietly form smaller groups in more intimate atmospheres, which Betas
tend to see as boring.

For Betas atmosphere is more important than specific activity or topic.
Groups of betas spend time together to entertain each other. They
exchange fun (and often loud) stories to feed the atmosphere, so that
the group energy won't run out. People talk fast and they often add
comments to other people's stories if they feel that the pace is slowing
down. When someone starts to talk, he takes on the obligation to
entertain for the duration of the monologue and, in a friendly group,
other people only interrupt to try and help him keep control of the
atmosphere.

Talking about personal matters in a group is not something that Betas
generally do. It's viewed almost as treachery when something that was
told in a one-on-one conversation is retold in front of a group, or when
someone criticizes another person's traits in front of the group. Betas
believe such things should be told in private and should not be used to
embarrass or belittle a friend.

Betas also don't like it when people tell long, slow stories. Betas try
to be polite and listen to the story, and they will forgive you if it
was boring for them, but if someone does it too often they might not be
invited back. Betas restrict long-winded stories to one-on-one
conversations. However, :doc:`IEIs <IEI>` are more likely to adjust to the
slower stories because they are very flexible conversationalists.

Romance styles
--------------

Beta romantic relationships tend to start from intense exchanges of
emotions, either of a playful, aggressive sort, or of a more "tormented"
sort based on personal images of special meaning, "romantic" in a
19th-century sense. The two sorts merge together to make Beta the quadra
most inclined towards "romantic courtship" in the everyday sense of the
term. A relationship is felt to be "lacking" if not accompanied by
intense demonstrations of emotions. Romantic relationships are also held
together by a sense of common goals and purpose, and of the other person
as the best partner towards achieving them. Betas are the most intense
of all quadras in terms of exchanges of emotional and sensual interplay.

Perception of other quadras
---------------------------

Alpha
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Betas tend to regard Alpha types as pleasant company, fun and creative,
but too goofy and present-oriented, lacking focus and ambition, needing
to be led, and more concerned with refining the world of ideas and fun
than the "real world".

Usually a group which consists of members of both quadras gets along
much better than Alpha-Beta interquadra pairs of people. In groups,
|symbol_e.gif| starts to dominate and there is a lot of active laughter
as the Betas tell loud stories, and the Alphas make goofy suggestions
for entertainment. On individual level, the differences are more
difficult to overcome because values are different.

Gamma
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Betas tend to regard Gamma types as stand-offish and occasionally
emotionally hostile, judgemental, and inclined to not seeing the "big
picture" in political or work situations, a combination of political
naivity and moral stiffness which may end up jeopardizing the Betas'
goals. Socially boring, "can't take a joke", vindictive. A group
consisting of Betas and Gammas does not mix well. Betas try to make
general jokes, but Gammas make extremely personal sharp jokes. Gammas
like everyone to take care of their own needs and people are constantly
moving and forming small groups but Betas want people to stay together.
Gammas feel that Betas are trying to restrict their fun and Betas feel
that Gammas are just trying to break the fun group. However, on a
personal level Betas and Gammas often get along very well - they discuss
politics, religion, nature, etc. They both see the general trends and
they compare predictions of what will happen next. Betas view the
general emotions motivating the events and Gammas view the objective
facts so they might not agree but the conversations are intriguing
nonetheless.

Delta
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Betas tend to regard Delta types as noncommittal in their unwillingness
to support goals decided in a group, lack of drive, and ethical
self-righteousness. Rather than back group efforts that require vision
and concentration of effort, Delta types prefer to just work on personal
projects. Equally mixed groups of Betas and Deltas get along just fine.
Nothing great, nothing horrible. Deltas tell their personal views, but
they don't feel comfortable enough to get too personal and Betas make
general jokes to entertain others but don't feel playful enough to make
loud jokes that might offend Deltas. But when there's a quadra
dominance, things go bad very fast. The Beta group is too loud and
impersonal for Deltas and the Delta group is too muted and personal for
Betas. Betas want to express their views and opinions very openly, while
Deltas want everyone to keep any possibly offensive views to themselves.
