Alpha Quadra
=====================

**Alpha**, or the 'first' :doc:`quadra <quadra>`, includes :doc:`ILE <ILE>`,
:doc:`SEI <SEI>`, :doc:`ESE <ESE>`, and :doc:`LII <LII>`. Dominant IM elements of
Alpha quadra: **Ne, Si, Fe, Ti**.

:doc:`Reinin <reinin_dich>` characterizes this quadra as Judicious,
Merry, and Democratic.

Dominant elements
-----------------

The **dominant** :doc:`IM elements <elements>` of the Alpha Quadra are
**Ne, Ti, Fe, Si** that correspond to symbols |symbol_i.gif|
|symbol_l.gif| |symbol_e.gif| |symbol_s.gif|, respectively. Grouping
together the elements of the :ref:`Ego blocks <ego-block>` of the Alpha Quadra
types, we get a picture of what aspects of life Alpha Quadra types
strive to bring to the forefront of life, as well as the kind of group
atmosphere and lifestyle they pursue.

**Ne** blocked with **Ti**: |symbol_i.gif| |symbol_l.gif|

-  Alpha types are inclined to discuss highly theoretical concepts as a
   source of intellectual stimulation and fun rather than for their
   practical merits.
-  Alpha types tend to value logically consistent beliefs and ideas, and
   behavior that is consistent with personal values.
-  Alpha types typically follow through on their ideas in the form of
   group activity.

**Fe** blocked with **Si**: |symbol_e.gif| |symbol_s.gif|

-  Alpha types tend to enjoy participating in groups where there is free
   exchange of positive emotional expression in an atmosphere pleasing
   to the senses.
-  Alpha types are inclined to discuss stories told in detail and
   according to the sequence in which events happened, rather than "jump
   to the point" quickly.
-  Alpha types are inclined to show affection for others in the form of
   small practical services or gifts.
-  Alpha types tend to feel energized in the positive atmosphere of
   special events, such as public holidays, parties and special
   celebrations.

Subdued elements
----------------

The **subdued**\ :doc:`IM elements <elements>` of the Alpha Quadra are
**Se, Ni, Te, Fi** that correspond to symbols |symbol_f.gif|
|symbol_t.gif| |symbol_p.gif| |symbol_r.gif|, respectively. Grouping
together the elements of the `Super-Ego <Super-Ego>` blocks of the
Alpha Quadra types, we get a picture of what aspects of life Alpha types
strive to keep hidden, avoid, not focus attention on, and keep at the
periphery of their lives.

**Se** blocked with **Fi**: |symbol_f.gif| |symbol_r.gif|

-  Alpha types prefer to avoid the discussion of controversial and
   unpleasant subjects regarding personal relationships while in groups,
   especially if leading to confrontations.
-  Alpha types are inclined to be tolerating of minor past misdeeds by
   others, giving priority to reconciliation and a convivial atmosphere.

**Ni** blocked with **Te**: |symbol_t.gif| |symbol_p.gif|

-  Alpha types are less likely to make investments that require
   long-term commitment and upkeep. They prefer short-term investments
   that offer a reliable outcome with minimal involvement.
-  Alpha types avoid taking direct life advice, preferring to experience
   and learn for themselves. They perceive people who try to give such
   advice as pedantic.

Group behavior
--------------

Inclination for comfortable and pleasant group atmosphere, in the
emotional, sensorial, and intellectual aspects. An ideal Alpha group
situation is the exchange of light-hearted jokes while discussing
imaginative ideas, movies, or sometimes sports, all while enjoying
pleasant food and drink. Narrating personal experiences usually takes
the form of telling a joke; funny personal experiences are preferred
over "serious" ones. The exchange of sober concrete details are avoided.
If the group is playing a game together, the fun and jokes that go along
with it are at least as important as the game itself. They avoid
generating "heavy" moments; any dramatic expressions are limited in
time, most often in service of a joke. Alphas are also perhaps the most
likely types to participate in group use of mind-altering substances.

Alpha discussions tend to go off on tangents, in whatever direction
seems most interesting or funny at the moment. Unusual personal
observations are common, resulting from the analysis of the
idiosyncrasies or inconsistencies of everyday life. If many in the group
share the same observations, they are likely to express their agreement
emphatically, so as to create a kind of "mental harmony" which enhances
the group dynamic. If a new problem is encountered, it is expanded and
developed in as many ways as possible, until some kind of satisfactory
conclusion is reached.

Alphas make no distinction between "insiders" and "outsiders", easily
drawing people into a conversation once it has begun éˆ¥?though they tend

to just as easily withdraw if the person is not receptive. Likewise,
they prefer to have the same behavior at work as at play; they find
formal speech and dress to be pretentious, unnecessarily limiting, and
even ridiculous. Alphas dislike the idea that there is something going
on "behind the scenes", preferring to keep things (especially personal
motivations) as open and straightforward as possible.

Romance styles
--------------

Romantic relationships usually evolve from sharing activities and
interests for fun in a two-person version of the group behavior
description above. Priority is given to keeping the partner happy in the
sense of a good mood and amused on a daily basis, with avoidance of
direct accusations or unnecessarily harsh criticism; relationships are
seen as a source of day-to-day fun and happiness. Focus on remembering
dates of particular significance and celebrating them. Playful
interactions are based around light teasing and making the partner
laugh; intimate atmospheres are based on generating a comfortable,
welcoming, cozy atmosphere.

Perception of other quadras
---------------------------

Beta
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Alphas tend to regard Beta types as "cool" and "fun", but also as bossy,
boorish and coarse. In social situations, Alphas often resign the lead
to Betas because Betas generally exert a 'vibe' of control over such
situations. When positive emotions are expressed between members of
these quadras, they get along quite well; however, Betas' negative
emotions are often perceived by Alphas as tiresome. Alphas often joke
light-heartedly in attempt to improve Betas' moods, or to gently
ridicule them.

Gamma
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Alphas tend to regard Gamma types warily, as stand-offish and
emotionally cold or even hostile, especially in work situations, as well
as inclined to play favorites with those they know better, or are
attracted to (for whatever reason, be it sexually or for power and
gain.) Alphas tend to see Gamma types as too harsh in their words and
unimaginative, lacking future perspective, and even disingenuous, as
well as having a mean streak of unforgivingness and vindictiveness.

Delta
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Alphas tend to regard Delta types as kindly and creative, but also as
pragmatic and serious. When Deltas give Alphas advice, Alphas often
perceive it as well-intentioned but too simplistic and direct. Alphas
often respect Deltas' principles, opinions, and caring attitudes;
however, they tend to perceive them as, at best, admirable and at worst,
demanding, rather than fun.
