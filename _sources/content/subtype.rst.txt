Subtype
===================

Introduction
------------

When individuals of the same socionic type can be grouped into
subcategories by certain traits, we speak of "**subtypes**." Many
socionists use some kind of subtype system to help describe :doc:`intratype differences <intratype_diff>`. A number of such systems are
familiar to many western readers.



Subtyping Systems
-----------------

This subtype theory is based on the premise that, within the same type,
some individuals are inclined to have an strengthening, focus, or
accentuation of a particular function(s) of their TIM model. This
strengthening has an effect across the entire TIM model, which
introduces variations to type expression within a type. Several
socionics authors have tried to capture subtype variations in their
descriptions of subtypes. Since type subtypes modify the expression of
several traits, such as extroversion/introversion and
rationality/irrationality along with others, some socionics
practitioners recognize their influence in determining type.

The most commonly used subtype systems are 2-subtype systems such as
"Contact/Inert" and "Accepting/Producing", and a 4-subtype system called
"Dominant/Creative/Normalizing/Harmonizing", abbreviated as DCNH.



Accepting / Producing Subtypes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Accepting/Producing subtypes refers to accentuation of :ref:`accepting functions <accepting>` (1, 3, 5, 7)
versus :ref:`producing functions <accepting>` (2, 4, 6, 8)
of TIM model.

**Accepting subtype** corresponds to accentuation of "accepting"
functions 1, 3, 5, 7; these are Program, Ignoring, Role, and
Suggestive.

**Producing subtype** corresponds to accentuation of "producing"
functions 2, 4, 6, 8; these are Creative, Demonstrative, Activating,
and Vulnerable.



Contact / Inert Subtypes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This system of subtypes was proposed by V. Meged and A. Ovcharov. It is
based on the premise that within a type some individuals will be more
inclined to focus on their :ref:`inert functions <contact>` (1, 4, 6, 7), and
others, on their :ref:`contact functions <contact>` (2, 3, 5, 8).

**Contact subtype** corresponds to strengthening of contact functions
2, 3, 5, 8. These are Creative, Demonstrative, Suggestive, and Role
:doc:`functions <functions>`.

**Inert subtype** corresponds to strengthening of inert functions 1,
4, 6, 7. These are Base, Ignoring, Activating, and Vulnerable
:doc:`functions <functions>`.

Theoretical information underpinning Contact-Inert subtype system is
further described in the following articles:

-  :ref:`Contact and Inert Functions <contact>`
-  :doc:`Contact and Inert Subtypes by Meged and Ovcharov <contact_inert_subtypes>`
-  :doc:`On Specialization of Functions of Model A by Tsypin <specialization_functions>`


Terminating / Initiating Subtypes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Terminating/Initiating is a subtype notation introduced by :doc:`Victor Gulenko <gulenko>`. This subtyping system is based on
strengthening of the :ref:`first, "program" function <leading-func>` versus the :ref:`second, "creative" function <creative-func>` of TIM model.

**Terminating (or terminal) subtype** refers to streightening of the
first, "program" function.

**Initiating (or initial) subtype** refers to strengthening of the
second, "creative" function.



DCNH Subtypes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

DCNH is a theory with 4 different subtypes proposed by Victor Gulenko.

* **Dominating subtype (D)**
* **Creative subtype (C)**
* **Normalizing subtype (N)**
* **Harmonizing subtype (H)**

Further explication and profiles of the four subtypes can be found in
the following articles:

-  :doc:`Theory of Subtypes: System of DCNH by Victor Gulenko <DCNH>`
-  :doc:`DCNH Subtypes: Empirical Portraits by Vera Borisova <DCNH_Borisova>`

Notation
--------

Like the names of core socionics types, subtypes can be called by
different names (though most are fairly similar). This nomenclature can
reference a particular subtyping system a person is using or assume a
more general form. For example, type EII with strengthened second,
creative intuitive function can be called:

-  Ne-EII or EII-Ne (the most common notation)
-  EII intuitive subtype
-  EII creative subtype
-  EII contact subtype
-  EII producing subtype
-  intuitive/producing/contact EII
-  terminating/initiating EII



Dual-type theory
----------------

Dual-type theory is the proposition that individuals are in possession
of two personality types which work together to create the experience of
reality, see :doc:`Dual-type theory <dual_type_theory>`. Although this
theory is highly speculative, Carl Jung himself hinted at the
possibility of more than one simultaneous type in :doc:`Psychological Types <psychological_types>`.



Criticism of subtype systems
----------------------------

Critics of subtype systems say that in practice an emphasis on
identifying subtypes draws attention away from the more central task of
:doc:`diagnosing type <diagnosis>`. Subtypes can be used as a
"cop-out" to avoid taking a stance on a person's type, or for explaining
traits and behavior that contradict the basic type the socionist has
diagnosed. Critics say that in many cases the basic type has been
incorrectly diagnosed, and the addition of a "subtype" simply masks the
contradiction.

Some socionists think that subtypes are best used to retroactively
explain behavior of a person whose type is already known.
