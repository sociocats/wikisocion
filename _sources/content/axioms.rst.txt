Fundamental categories of socionic theory
---------------------------------------------------

* Information metabolism is the process of perceiving, processing, and producing information performed by the central nervous system.
* An aspect of information metabolism is a category that defines a subset of information that participates in the information metabolism and possesses certain structural qualities: static/dynamic, body/field, and external/internal.
* A function is a structure or module of thought that accumulates, processes, and produces information of a certain information aspect in a certain way.
* A type of information metabolism is a taxonomic category that describes the relative strength or role of the different functions within the nervous system of an individual. 

Axioms of socionics

* People can be categorized using the four Jungian dichotomies: rational / irrational, extraverted / introverted, logic / ethics, intuitive / sensing.
* The resulting types formed by the four Jungian dichotomies are discrete.
* IM type does not change over a person's life (challenged by some socionists)
* Interpersonal relations between people depend, to some degree, on the socionic types of the participants.
