The INFj comes across as a completely different entity. In comfortable
social settings, including one-on-one dialogues, he comes off almost as
an attention-starved performing monkey, acting in eccentric ways and
flooding you with his behavior if you even show the slightest amount of
reinforcement (ESTjs seem to eat this stuff up.) He is highly obsessed
with his image, to the point of being in love with it. He is highly
immersed in most social expectancies, although he often comes across as
somewhat awkward, almost like he "tries too hard". His social relations
are highly varied. There are some who hate him, some who absolutely love
him, and some who latch onto him and never let go. His intelligence is
strange and annoying to alot of people. He seems to have a knack for
picking up random knowledge and half-truths. In conversation, he will
often argue about many of your own premises and add highly questionable
information to fill in the (supposed) gaps. So it goes without saying
that discussion with him is extremely frustrating. He often likes to
give advice, and many people even actively seek him for it. He is highly
interested in people, and he knows more people than I could ever
imagine. He is overly focused on others' weaknesses, which makes him
almost impossible to impress. Although he is very easy to talk about
feelings and emotions with.

-------------------

Disclaimer: This is an observation of one EII and doesn't reflect my
view of all EIIs.

Always strutting around with a very proud demeanor, brilliant dresser
and never seemed to look me in the eyes (did with other people).
Insanely physically careless; she would stomp in the house at 3am on
weeknights singing loudly slamming doors and cupboards. If you happened
to watch her move around the kitchen she seemed to just sloppily chuck
instruments and ingredients around in a manner that would create a drink
or a meal. The mess she made seemed inappropriately large in relation to
what she had to do. She liked to listen to music in the shower, although
I am pretty sure she couldn't hear the music in the shower since 1) the
music system was too far away/water hitting the bath was too loud 2) you
could hear her singing different songs that weren't being played on the
system.

She had a quite a few friends everywhere that she invited over to her
place; she almost had someone over every other day. Talked in a very
wistful and deep way about personal sentiments and expected you to do
the same. Often had long telephone conversation. She went clubbing a
lot, she sort of approached the clubbing scene with an air of innocence
and romance, didn't seem to like the idea of going just to get some
dick. She would often throw some very strong judgments at the other
women at clubs with some very strong language.

Prone to grudges and rages (screaming, physically attacking, throwing
crockery), would constantly nag people over small petty things until she
had won. To me all the fights look strategically pointless as she never
really got anything of any proper value from the fights although her
methods where quite effective.

Couldn't fix a thing, if anything broke down that she relied on she
spent more time swearing and complaining than fixing.

Also very ignorant.

**EII Response to "Housemate"**

I don't relate to that EII much. I have a serious demeanor, not a
"proud" one. I am very quiet and would never stomp around the house like
she would. I even turn doorknobs so closing the door isn't so loud even
when everyone is up. I don't listen to music in the shower. I am
reluctant to initiate social gatherings and am out with someone maybe
once a month (though consider that I see friends on campus every day).
Even though I'm reluctant, I'm usually the only one doing any effort to
get together. I hate talking on the telephone. I am not near assertive
enough to "throw judgements" at people.

I do, however, wistfully talk about personal sentiments and I'm not able
to fix anything. What do you mean by ignorant? If you're talking about
facts, then yes, I find seraching for information draining because you
have to sift through a bunch of useless information before finding
anything useful...and it's boring. HOWEVER, I am very NOT ignorant when
it comes to people. I find it energizing to find information about
people and CONSTANTLY complain that no one knows the pain, needs, or
desires of anyone else. - User: Faquille
