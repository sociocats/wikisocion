Extraversion and introversion (psychology)
================================================

The terms **extraversion** and **introversion** in modern psychology
have somewhat different meanings from socionic
:doc:`extraversion <extroverted>` and :doc:`introversion <introverted>` and
even from those of :doc:`Carl Jung <jung>`, who popularized the term.

The probable cause of this is that modern psychology focuses on
quantifiable external behavior, while socionics focuses more on
qualitative internal differences. If one applies the psychological
meaning of extraversion and introversion to diagnosing socionic types,
there will be numerous mistakes, and the supposed :doc:`intertype relations <intertype>` between these types will not match
reality. In socionics, gregarious :doc:`introtims <introverted>` and
reclusive, focused :doc:`extratims <extroverted>` are possible, though in many
or most cases the psychological definitions can be applied.



Extraversion and introversion according to Jung
----------------------------------------------------------

From `Wikipedia <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraversion>`__:

''According to Carl Jung, introversion and extraversion refer to the
direction of psychic energy. If a persons energy usually flows
outwards, he or she is an extravert, while if this energy normally flows
inwards, this person is an introvert. Extraverts feel an increase of
perceived energy when interacting with a large group of people, but a
decrease of energy when left alone. Conversely, introverts feel an
increase of energy when alone, but a decrease of energy when surrounded
by a large group of people.

Most modern psychologists consider theories of psychic energy to be
obsolete. First, it is difficult to operationalize mental "energy" in a
way that can be scientifically measured and tested. Second, more
detailed explanations of extraversion and the brain have replaced Jung's
rather speculative theories. Nevertheless, the concept is still in
popular usage in the general sense of "feeling energized" in particular
situations. Jungs primary legacy in this area may be the popularizing
of the terms introvert and extravert to refer to a particular dimension
of personality.

In other words, while :doc:`Jung's <jung>` understanding of extraversion
and introversion are related to that of modern psychology, the terms are
now interpreted differently in practice.

Extraversion and introversion in psychology
-------------------------------------------

In modern psychology, extraverts (sometimes called "extroverts") are
gregarious, assertive, and generally seek out excitement. Introverts, in
contrast, are more reserved, less outgoing, and less sociable. They are
not necessarily asocial, but they tend to have smaller circles of
friends, and are less likely to thrive on making new social contacts.
According to the Big Five factors, **extraversion** denotes energy,
positive emotions, surgency, and the tendency to seek stimulation and
the company of others.

From
`Wikipedia <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits>`__:

''Extraversion (also "extroversion") is marked by pronounced engagement
with the external world. Extraverts enjoy being with people, are full of
energy, and often experience positive emotions. They tend to be
enthusiastic, action-oriented individuals who are likely to say "Yes!"
or "Let's go!" to opportunities for excitement. In groups they like to
talk, assert themselves, and draw attention to themselves.

Introverts lack the exuberance, energy, and activity levels of
extraverts. They tend to be quiet, low-key, deliberate, and less
dependent on the social world. Their lack of social involvement should
not be interpreted as shyness or depression; the introvert simply needs
less stimulation than an extravert and more time alone to re-charge
their batteries.

Sample Extraversion items:

-  I am the life of the party.
-  I don't mind being the center of attention.
-  I feel comfortable around people.
-  I start conversations.
-  I talk to a lot of different people at parties.
-  I am quiet around strangers. (reversed)
-  I don't like to draw attention to myself. (reversed)
-  I don't talk a lot. (reversed)
-  I have little to say. (reversed)
-  I keep in the background. (reversed)

Extraversion has been linked to higher sensitivity of the mesolimbic
dopamine system to potentially rewarding stimuli (Depue & Collins,
1999). This in part explains the high levels of positive affect found in
Extraverts, since they will more intensely feel the excitement of a
potential reward. One consequence of this is that Extraverts can more
easily learn the contingencies for positive reinforcement, since the
reward itself is experienced as greater.''

Extraversion and introversion in socionics
------------------------------------------

Socionics' understanding of :doc:`extraversion <extroverted>` and
:doc:`introversion <introverted>` is closer to :doc:`Jung's <jung>` than to
that of modern psychology. An individual is extraverted if his
perception is primarily directed at objects in the outside world,
whereas introverts' perception is primarily directed at the way these
objects resonate with each other and within the observer's psyche.
Extraversion and introversion are not absolute qualities, since half of
one's :doc:`psychic function <functions>` are extraverted and half
introverted. One's perception skips around between extraverted and
introverted functions. However, the :ref:`leading function <leading-func>` is most dominant and defines the
individual's extraversion or introversion.

While there is probably some correlation between outgoingness and
socionics extraversion, this connection is not actually implied in the
theory. People of the same type can differ on psychological scales of
extraversion, and some socionic introtims are more "extraverted" (i.e.
gregarious, sociable) than some extratims. Also, :doc:`Gamma <gamma_quadra>` and
:doc:`Delta <delta_quadra>` types may on average be less extraverted than
:doc:`Alpha <alpha_quadra>` and :doc:`Beta <beta_quadra>` types due to subdued
