Democratic and aristocratic
=====================================

**Aristocracy** / **Democracy** is one of the 15 `Reinin dichotomies <reinin_dich>`.

Aristocratic and democratic types
---------------------------------

-  Democratic types are all :doc:`Alpha <alpha_quadra>` and :doc:`Gamma <gamma_quadra>`
   types, namely, :doc:`LII <LII>`, :doc:`ESE <ESE>`, :doc:`SEI <SEI>`,
   :doc:`ILE <ILE>`, :doc:`ESI <ESI>`, :doc:`LIE <LIE>`, :doc:`ILI <ILI>`,
   :doc:`SEE <SEE>`.
-  Aristocratic types are all :doc:`Beta <beta_quadra>` and :doc:`Delta <delta_quadra>`
   types, namely, :doc:`LSI <LSI>`, :doc:`EIE <EIE>`, :doc:`IEI <IEI>`,
   :doc:`SLE <SLE>`, :doc:`EII <EII>`, :doc:`LSE <LSE>`, :doc:`SLI <SLI>`,
   :doc:`IEE <IEE>`.
-  Using the :doc:`four-letter code <type_names>`: democrats are NT
   or SF, aristocrats are NF or ST.




Typical characteristics
-----------------------

Aristocrats
~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Inclined to perceive and refer to other people, and themselves, by
   means of groupings and categories that they see these people
   belonging to; these groupings may be created and defined by the
   Aristocrats themselves, rather than be already existing and socially
   defined ones.
#. Their initial attitude towards another person is influenced by their
   attitude towards the grouping they see this person belonging to.
#. Tend to attribute common qualities to members of same groupings, and
   define such groupings by these same qualities.
#. Inclined to refer to others using expressions that mention
   generalized features of their groupings.

Democrats
~~~~~~~~~

#. Perceive and refer to other people, and themselves, primarily
   describing individual, personal qualities: frank, trustworthy,
   generous, unimaginative, lighthearted, good-looking, etc. which are
   generally not in connection to any grouping to which they might
   belong.
#. Form their relationships and attitudes toward other persons based on
   their own individual characteristics, rather than taking into account
   which grouping these persons fall into or their own relationships
   with the members of these circles and groupings.
#. Not inclined to perceive people as representatives of a certain
   grouping that supposedly possesses qualities inherent to people who
   comprise it.
#. When referring to others, not inclined to use expressions that
   mention the generalized features of the grouping or categories that
   these people belong to.


Extended characteristics
------------------------

Taken from :doc:`2003 study of Reinin traits <reinin_study>`.

Democrats
~~~~~~~~~

-  Democrat perceives and distinguishes himself primarily through
   personal qualities. Perceiving other people, their personal qualities
   are likewise primary for him (how close, interesting, pleasant or
   unpleasant this individual is to him personally; their intelligence,
   ideas, appearance, tastes, etc.). Because of this, individualism is
   inherent to the democrat: "I am I".
-  Democrat forms his attitude toward a specific person based on their
   personal characteristics (authority, intellect, personal
   achievements, etc.). The democrat recognizes superiority of certain
   individuals drawing from their personal qualities. The relation of
   the democrat to another person will not be based on their belonging
   to one group or another, as well as on their relations to the
   representatives of these groups.
-  Democratic types are not inclined to perceive people with whom they
   associate as representatives of a certain "circle of contacts", which
   possesses special characteristics, inherent precisely to the members
   of this circle.
-  Democrat is not inclined to use expressions that generalize "group
   features" of certain individuals (for example, "a typical
   representative").

Aristocrats
~~~~~~~~~~~

-  The aristocrat frequently perceives and defines himself an other
   people through group associations (division into groups can occur
   based on almost any criteria: professional or theoretical, by age or
   nationality, by place of residence or which floor the persons live
   on, etc.), for example: "I'm a representative of..." "This person is
   from such and such...". Collectivism is more inherent to the
   aristocrat.
-  Their attitude toward another person forms under the influence of
   their attitude towards the group to which the person belongs. To the
   aristocrat, it is incomprehensible how it is possible to belong to
   two opposing groups at the same time: "You are either with us, or
   with them and against us".
-  Aristocrat distinguished his "circle of contacts" by certain traits,
   realizes its certain "specialty".
-  In speech aristocrat frequently use expressions like "group",
   "typical representative of", "our", "all of them are like that", etc.

**Notes**

#. Briefly, the essence of each of these attributes can be expressed as
   follows: primacy of collective "we" (Aristocrats) or of individual
   "I" (Democrats) and the corresponding values.
#. It is possible to say that the aristocrat is to a larger degree a
   social being, an the democratindividualistic. Therefore, the dispute
   of what is more importantsociety or the individualcannot be
   resolved.
#. From the point of view of social psychology, in perception of a new
   person the aristocrat strongly involves the mechanism of social
   recognition: casual attribution (the degree depends on uniqueness and
   social conditionality of behavior) and "halo/aura" effect (which
   manifests when the individual has little information about a new
   person). Both of them are a part of the process of stereotyping
   (perception/recognition through a stereotype) [1, with. 128].

**Hypotheses**

*Aristocrats:* Ethical intuitive types create new groups ("inhabitants
of suburbs", "typical representative of a new generation of
goalkeepers")adding up or summing up certain cumulative features which
are inherent in the majority. Logical sensing types use these groupings
that have been created by ethical intuitives, switching to their strong
logical function and building a system of personal relations on its
basis.

*Democrats:* In perception of a democrat, a group is created from
individuals drawn together on basis of a common interest, project, idea
(for logical intuitive types) or on basis of mutual sentiments and
sympathies (for ethical sensing types). Additionally, a group in
perception of democratic types is not the basis for creating a social
hierarchy.

**Influence of this attribute on determination of the type of
personality**

#. Hierarchy and status are frequently described as inherent to
   structural logic (Ti). According to our observations this is entirely
   false. White logic (Ti) types of the first quadra will adhere to
   formal requirements, but will not begin to reconstruct all of their
   behavior in accordance to a new status. In this manner will act the
   aristocrats of the second quadra, most obviously the sensing logical
   types. Some confusion can arise due to this. If we were to observe,
   we would see that other aristocratic types are no less inclined to
   such "status games", for example "I demand that they relate to me as
   the director" (EIE), "I cannot associate with those of a higher
   position than me" (IEE).
#. Division of people into "mine" and "not mine" is frequently
   attributed to aristocracy. In actuality, this division holds true for
   any types that values white ethics (Fi), including the democratic
   types (SEE, and in particular ESI). If we expand this concept, then
   "my" is any person with whom close relations have been formed, there
   is a familiar connection or sincere attachment. For the IEE an EII
   sincere attachment and belonging to a group become combined: "mine"
   and "not mine" for them are members of "their group" or "foreign
   group".
#. Switching from "you" to "formal you" [Russian language and a few
   other languages have formal and informal forms of reference] is not
   always significant from the point of view of manifestation of this
   attribute. According to the standards of etiquette and rules of
   behavior, it is accepted to address older people and those in senior
   position with formal form of "you" (with respect), and different
   informal situations, regardless of the rules, require switch to
   informal "you". For instance if a child's mother is the teacher in
   his class, then the child will refer to her with formal "you" in
   class. It is possible to give more example of this. The important
   thing is not how they are addressed, but the reason for doing so.

**Examples**

*Democrats:* "I'm not interested in social affiliations of a person or
other social 'marks' they may have" "I don't even have thoughts of
establishing someone's affiliations to any groups. A person is a unit"
"It is important what the individual represents" "When I interact with
somebody I don't really care whether they are a man or a woman" "It is
difficult for me to determine what constitutes belonging to a group, I
cannot isolate that something that differentiates from others" "I am a
representative only of my own ideas" "I notice groups, but it's just a
game (they are not real, the groups are pretended)".

*Aristocrats:* "I perceive people based on their group affiliations,
place everyone "on a shelf" ("a good mother", "a charming person",
etc.)" "If it is possible to determine in which grouping the person
belongs, then this is reassuring. It is easier to receive information
from someone knowing which group they are a part of" "I separate people
based on their professional capabilities. First: to what social and
economic stratus the person belongs to. Second: is he a professional or
not, the way he conducts himself, his individual qualities" "I am
referring to you as to a typical representative of translators" "At my
workplace they hired a new secretary recently, and she works poorly, and
in general is not that kind of a person. May be because she is from the
suburbs... please don't misunderstand me, I'm not an aristocrat! I'm
not!" "For me this religion means nothing, but for the ordinary people
it is necessary" "You are my friend, but my friends don't steal toilet
paper from McDonalds!"

**Investigation of Quadra Attributes:** The concept of a "quadra spirit"
or "quara values" can be expressed through the filling of three quadra
attributes. Thus, for example, a song from 1930: "We shall sing and
laugh alike children, in persistent struggle and labor"was composed by
a person belonging to the second quadra, not because of the "quadra
spirit", but because two attributes are embedded within itsubjectivism
and decisivenessthe combination of which exists only in the second
quadra.

Additional Commentary and Notes
-------------------------------

See also: `Sociotypograph  determine your sociotype by Renin dichotomies <http://zhilkin.com/socio/en/>`_.

It has been noted that there exists a considerable overlap in traits
assigned to Aristocratic/Democratic dichotomy in socionics and to
instincts and instinctual combinations in the enneagram model, leading
to frequent confusions of their properties. The descriptions of the
valued Social instinct, in particular, outline a similar set of traits
to the ones attributed to Aristocratic types in Reinin dichotomies. Here
is a sample description of valued Social instinct from `Enneagram Institute <http://www.enneagraminstitute.com/articles/nartinstvar.asp>`_:

"**Social**: *This subtype is focused on their interactions with other
people and with the sense of value or esteem they derive from their
participation in collective activities. These include work, family,
hobbies, clubsbasically any arena in which Social types can interact
with others for some shared purpose. ... Within that social instinct,
however, are many other implicit imperatives, and primary among them is
the understanding of "place" within a hierarchical social structure.*"

That is, valued Social instinct is associated with greater awareness of
social and cultural spheres of life, social norms and conventions,
social standing and hierarchies, and the inclination to participate in
the collective activities. All of this may be mistakenly interpreted as
socionics "Aristocratic" trait (especially for stackings that have
secondary Social instinct, for whom the social sphere is often an area
of creative exploration). Conversely, social-last stackings sp/sx and
sx/sp possess a lowered awareness of the social and cultural spheres,
decreased interest in group activities and collective themes, and
exhibit greater social insularity and even disregard or rejection of
social norms and conventions, which is easily confused with socionics
"Democratic" traits.

Since the differences between the socionics Aristocratic/Democratic
trait and properties of the enneagram social instinct have never been
clearly explained, **it is inadvisable to rely on this dichotomy in
typing.**

Examples
--------

Expressions that possibly demonstrate "Aristocratic" traits, such as
propensity to view people as having certain positions within a group,
generalization of qualities of one individual onto a broader contingent,
and explicit regulation of relations:

-  EII: "It's always important to have a sense of humility and to know
   your place (mine just happens to be at the top). Remember to support
   those below you - if your inferiors falter, there will be no pyramid
   for you to stand at the top of." - hierarchical attribution ("your
   place").

-  EII: "you don't know shit and you need to learn your place" -
   hierarchical attribution ("your place").

-  EII: "You could have at least done a service for yourself and others
   by admitting that you are at fault, which you didn't have the decency
   to do while you were discussing this with me." - explicit/public
   regulation of relations.

-  SLE-IEI conversation: SLE - "You have no idea what went on, you're
   assuming shit. She started ignoring me because I was being "mean".
   Like I said, I was out of my element with this girl, duals are
   jealous around each other. She felt the same way. Please, know your
   place woman." IEI in response - '"Know *your* place. If you're not
   seeing each other exclusively you have no right to treat her as your
   exclusive property and think you somehow have a "right" to determine
   who she can/can't hang out with and "punish" her accordingly, duality
   or not. And even then it's questionable. Grow up, grow balls, etc."

Stratievskaya on "Aristocratic" quadra and relations (excepts from
various blog entries):

From `IEE-ILI mirage relations <http://www.the16types.info/vbulletin/showthread.php/43943-Article-Mirage-Relations-INTp-and-ENFp-by-Stratiyevskaya>`_:

-  "For example, one may leave for a vacation and ask the IEE to
   complete some task or activity, and upon return find it ruined in all
   respects, with no further possibility to restore it or straighten
   things out. There was agreement  then there was no agreement, and
   why is this?  there won't be any answer. At best IEE will reply: "I
   did not hire myself out to work for you!" (aristocracy)."

-  "Furthermore, here we have interaction between a "democratic" type
   and an "aristocratic" type: IEE dislikes being a servant to and doing
   errands for the ILI. The mere hint of such a possibility is annoying
   to the IEE. Therefore, under any circumstances he tries not to give
   in to any hints, suggestions, requests, or even demands of ILI. He
   attempts to stay on the dominant position under any circumstances,
   from the heights of which IEE dispenses the necessary assistance at
   the right time in the form of valuable advice, as a knowledgeable
   person and as a seasoned professional."

From `EII-LIE semi-duality relations <http://www.the16types.info/vbulletin/showthread.php/43189-Article-Semi-duality-Relations-INFj-and-ENTj-by-Stratiyevskaya>`_:

-  "LIE will have difficulty understanding and dealing with the "petty"
   (aristocratic, ceremonious) ethics of relations of EII, since LIE is
   subconsciously oriented at democratic ethic of relations of his dual
   ESI, whose ethical function is directed at providing immediate and
   effective assistance in critical situations and not at "ceremonious"
   regulation of relationships. Therefore, the callowness and
   negligibility of EII's grievances and offenses will soon start to
   annoy the LIE: "How can he (EII) become so offended over such minor
   things!"

-  "This is something that I (EII) did not like in him (LIE) - his
   attitude towards women. He did not indulge them, did not tell them
   beautiful compliments - he did not idolize his women. No - he was a
   kind and attentive man. I never heard a bad word from him, but
   neither did he voice any compliments - such a person he was. He has
   never told me that he loved me, or even that he missed me ...
   (Aristocratic, subordinate to rituals ethics of relations of EII is
   not consistent with the democratic, free from accumulations of ritual
   relations ethics of 3rd quadra. Each quadra has its own code of
   ethics.)"

Theoretical properties of aristocratic and democratic types
-----------------------------------------------------------

-  Aristocrats have the **logical** and **sensing** :doc:`IM elements <elements>` in the same blocks of :doc:`Model A <model_a>`.

Here is a possible interpretation of this:

*Material assets are systematized and automated. Systems and production
have a material expression. Ideas exist for people and societal
relationships. People and relationships are valued for their personality
and potential.*

-  Democrats have the **ethical** and '''sensing ''' :doc:`IM elements <elements>` in the same blocks of :doc:`Model A <model_a>`.

Here is a possible interpretation of this:

*Material assets exist for people and societal relationships. Systems
and production are intangible or out of sight. Ideas and vision exist
for technology and systems. People and relationships are valued for
their effect and their comfort.*

When analyzing this dichotomy from the perspective of :doc:`model A <model_a>`, :doc:`Augusta <augusta>` listed all the blocks in this
dichotomy (so |symbol_l.gif| with |symbol_f.gif|, |symbol_e.gif| with
|symbol_t.gif| etc for Aristocracy and |symbol_f.gif| with
|symbol_r.gif|, |symbol_p.gif| with |symbol_t.gif| etc for Democracy),
attributing specific traits to each block which she extended to
characteristics of each dichotomy as whole. They are not all obviously
connected to a focus or lack thereof on groups as per the most common
definition of this dichotomy and as listed in the "typical
characteristics" section below.

A possible explanation for this trait regarding group thinking goes as
follows. Aristocratic reasoning merely structures
logically(|symbol_l.gif|) characteristics they have observed
(|symbol_f.gif|) in several individuals, being thus a logical
"connecting of the dots" applied to people. From a purely logical
|symbol_l.gif| perspective applied to |symbol_f.gif| perceptions and
goals, it makes perfect sense to assume that, if you perceive an
individual as belonging to a group posssessing some traits you have
already concluded are characteristic of that group, said individual will
exhibit those traits. For example, if in your experience so far
(|symbol_f.gif|) all persons belonging to a particular division in a
company have been unhelpful, it makes sense to conclude logically
(|symbol_l.gif|) in a purely impersonal way that that is a
characteristic of that division, and extrapolate that to further persons
from that group. From the point of view of primitive societies or
situations of non-organized warfare and conflict, such a reasoning may
even be crucial for survival since it allows you to estimate who your
enemies are before they attack you.

By contrast, the Democratic reasoning focuses on observations
|symbol_f.gif| on a case-by-case basis, that is of the individual they
happen to be interacting with at the moment (|symbol_r.gif|). A focus on
|symbol_r.gif| does not lead to creating logical structures, but to
forming stable connections to persons on individual-to-indvidual basis,
and in that case there is no point to, and no inclination for,
considerations of whether the observed reality |symbol_f.gif| of the
person fits into a broader logical structure of a group
(|symbol_l.gif|).

This explanation seems more obvious in connection to the :doc:`Beta <beta_quadra>`
quadra; far less so in the case of :doc:`Delta <delta_quadra>` since the
|symbol_f.gif| + |symbol_l.gif| block is subdued. Another way of
explaining this for :doc:`Delta <delta_quadra>` might be through the
|symbol_i.gif| + |symbol_r.gif| block; on the basis that the realization
of someone's potential (|symbol_i.gif|) is realized via connections with
others (|symbol_r.gif|), and that one of Delta's characteristics is the
formation of groups towards worthy and productive goals.
