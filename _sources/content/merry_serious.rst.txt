Merry and serious
=======================

**Merry** / **Serious**, also known as **Subjectivist** /
**Objectivist** or **Ascending** / **Descending**, is one of the 15
:doc:`Reinin dichotomies <reinin_dich>`.


Merry and serious types
-----------------------

-  Merry types are all :doc:`Alpha <alpha_quadra>` and :doc:`Beta <beta_quadra>` types,
   namely, :doc:`LII <LII>`, :doc:`ESE <ESE>`, :doc:`SEI <SEI>`, :doc:`ILE <ILE>`,
   :doc:`LSI <LSI>`, :doc:`EIE <EIE>`, :doc:`IEI <IEI>`, :doc:`SLE <SLE>`.
-  Serious types are all :doc:`Gamma <gamma_quadra>` and :doc:`Delta <delta_quadra>` types,
   namely, :doc:`ESI <ESI>`, :doc:`LIE <LIE>`, :doc:`ILI <ILI>`, :doc:`SEE <SEE>`,
   :doc:`EII <EII>`, :doc:`LSE <LSE>`, :doc:`SLI <SLI>`, :doc:`IEE <IEE>`.


Typical characteristics
-----------------------

Merry
~~~~~

#. Good at noticing emotional background and perceive the emotional
   aspect (particularly 'fun') separate from the activity.
#. 'Getting to know someone' happens naturally, and they are well aware
   of the purpose(s) for which they are meeting. The proper emotional
   distance is easily established, adapted/regulated, and manipulated,
   and they easily decrease distance through their emotional
   'brilliance'. A person's name (and other formalities) are peripheral
   to their relation with and interest in them, and thus they don't care
   much about formal introductions..
#. Not inclined to deduce 'objective truths' from their own and others'
   experiences  everything is relative. This relativity is perceived as
   an extenuation of the differing beliefs, opinions, intentions, etc.
   of each person. Accordingly, another person's actions are judged as
   correct or incorrect according to a set of subjective criteria. They
   attempt to compare others' views to their own, and to explain their
   own views in order to make sure that all parties understand the
   concepts being spoken of.
#. They are inclined to propose (or impose) another conception of the
   situation ('look at it this way'). If they think something is done
   incorrectly, they will ask WHY it was done that way. When talking
   about optimums, they are inclined to do it subjectively ('optimum
   compared to what?').
#. Fun is involvement, active participation; a state of constant
   excitement that one cannot confuse with leisure or rest. I have my
   own ideas about how things should be done  a 'mind of my own'  but
   so does everyone else.

Serious
~~~~~~~

#. Bad at noticing emotional background and do not separate the
   emotional aspect (particularly 'fun') from the activity.
#. Acquaintance with others is established by ritual (e.g.,
   introduction), and they prefer if the context of interaction is
   externally set (eg, by a mediator (think 'arranged marriages') or
   situation) so that they can skip the first phases and begin closer
   interaction. They approach others through stages defined by 'rules'
   and 'rituals', which may be created by themselves and/or already
   existing; thus, they are very aware of the stages of the process of
   acquaintance  e.g., when a person is no longer a stranger. The
   title, name, and any other information about the other person are
   considered important, and for this reason formal introduction is
   important.
#. Inclined to believe there are 'objective truths'  the truth is not
   always relative. Therefore, they believe that there are two types of
   actions/perspectives: those which are subjective (connected with
   personal preferences and motivations) and those which are objective
   (only one 'correct' or 'best' way of doing something). Whether
   something is correct or not is judged by comparing it with what they
   see as 'objectively correct'. In disagreement, they first attempt to
   make sure that the other person understands the concepts and terms
   'correctly'.
#. They are inclined to offer (or impose) what they see as the 'best' or
   'correct' way of doing something ('it should be done like this'). If
   they think something is done incorrectly, they ask WHO did it that
   way. When speaking of optimums, they are inclined to do so
   objectively (the 'absolute' optimum).
#. It is difficult for me to differentiate between activity/work and
   fun; work is necessarily fun  without an element of entertainment,
   it would be impossible If something is being done the wrong way?
   Oy! IMO, there is only one proper way to 'hammer a nail'

------------------------

Taken from :doc:`2003 study of Reinin traits <reinin_study>`.

Subjectivists
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Subjectivists are good at noticing the general emotional background
   that accompanies contact with people (For example: enthusiasm, fun,
   stress and so on). Fun (as, probably, every other emotional
   experience) for them is allocated into a separate aspects of activity
   (to a question "what were you doing" they can answer "we were having
   fun"they perceive emotional engagement as a separate type of
   activity)
-  Subjectivist types do not perceive "getting to know somebody" as a
   special kind of activity, in contrast to Serious types, for whom it
   is a kind of a ritual. They know very well why they are getting
   acquainted (the purpose of this acquaintance is interest, business,
   travel, and so on). In contrast to the Objectivist types, they do not
   divide the process of getting acquainted into consecutive stages.
   They immediately establish the necessary emotional distance in
   contact and can regulate it as needed. To bridge the gap between
   poorly acquainted people in a group they amp up the emotional
   tonethis can be mutually experienced happiness or misfortune. The
   "name" of the person is of secondary relevance for them. Interest
   towards the person and relations is primary here, thus Merry types do
   not consider formality as a necessary part of becoming acquainted
   with someone.
-  The Subjectivist, in contrast to the Objectivist, is not inclined to
   derive "objectively accurate" rules and regularities, generalizing
   for this purpose his own experiences and experiences of others.
   Instead, the Subjectivist assumes that other people have different
   criteria and their own views on any situation, therefore he
   determines whether his or someone else's actions were correct or
   incorrect by comparing them with his "subjective" viewhe evaluates
   them in accordance to his personal concepts, "his system", his
   intentions, and so on. Subjectivist are inclined to propose (or
   impose) not the "correct way" or another way to do things, but an
   entire conceptual framework on the subject i.e. they do not say "Do
   this differently" but rather "Look at it in another way". They do not
   think, in contrast to Objectivists, that in every situation there
   exists only one "objectively correct/true" way of doing somethingin
   their opinion, there are many different ways of looking at and
   approaching a given situation. When they feel something was done
   incorrectly, they will likely ask: "What are you doing?" (In contrast
   to Objectivists who are likely to ask "Who does it this way?"). When
   they speak of optimality, they mean optimality within the framework
   of their idea or concept, within the framework of their subjective
   approach (from which point of view is it most optimal and in
   comparison to what). Therefore they strive to contrast other people's
   views to their own and to explain their position (to verify
   concepts): "If this is what is meant, we do this, if something else
   is meant, we do it differently."
-  "Comparison and verification of concepts" is a common phenomenon
   among Subjectivists. It concerns not only their methods, but also
   their understanding, terminology, and so on. Subjectivists are
   attuned to the fact that different people might understand and
   interpret different concepts and terms differently. They perceive
   terminology as well as actions of other people as a part of the
   subjective concept inseparable from personal opinion, position,
   intent, etc.: "So we have agreed that we shall call it this way". In
   contrast to Objectivists who perceive terminology as "objective",
   Subjectivists understand personal differences behind terminilogy
   (this applies even to well established terms) and they attempt to
   compare and verify them ("Well you say this, but I think it's not so,
   but so-and-so").
-  Lexicon: when discussing actions and joint activities they use
   expressions such as "From my point of view", "According to my
   understanding", "To my knowledge", "personal criteria", "it
   corresponds to my understanding" "I have concluded" "he insisted" and
   so on. They describe verbal communication in detailhow their
   intervention in the situation is transpiring or why it's not
   happening.

Objectivists
~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Serious types poorly recognize common emotional background; they do
   not perceive emotionally infused conceptions (for example "fun") as
   separate and substitute them with interpretations that have no direct
   emotional elements. (Instead of the word "fun" they may use
   "entertainment", "leisure", "pleasure", and so on). They do not
   perceive emotional exchange as a separate occurrence and are inclined
   to mix it with other mutual matters (They can have fun while working,
   or engage in serious affairs while having fun.)
-  For Serious types, becoming acquainted with a new person constitutes
   a special ritual necessary for bridging the distance (If this ritual
   did not take place, then Serious types do not consider themselves to
   be acquainted, for example: "We did not introduce ourselves"). In
   such situations, for the Serious types it is easier if the degree of
   emotional distance was externally predetermined i.e. if it was set by
   some sort of "mediator", whether this be a person or circumstances of
   a given situationthis allows them to skip the first stages of
   becoming acquainted and move on to a closer dialogue and contact. For
   bridging the distance between strangers, Serious types create certain
   rules or rituals (or they use already existing ones) for the
   step-by-step association. They know the process of becoming
   acquainted very well (how a stranger becomes a familiar). For
   association, Serious type needs to know the name, title, any other
   information that describes the new persontherefore formal
   introduction for them is a very important stage of getting acquainted
   with someone.
-  Objectivists have a notion of what constitutes "objectively known"
   facts, rules, laws, regularities held in general (common) experience;
   in their perception there exist rules and guidelines that are "true
   in general" and "always correct". They suppose that other people can
   have their own views and positions, but do not consider that any
   action can be viewed as correct/incorrect only from a certain point
   of view (they allow for the existence of "objectively correct"
   actions). Therefore, from the point of view of an Objectivist,
   actions can be differentsubjective, determined by personal
   preferences and motives, and objective, where there is only one
   "correct", "most effective" way to do something. Objectivists define
   actions as correct or incorrect contrasting them to their
   representation of what is "objectively correct". When they think that
   there is only one optimal solution, they are inclined to propose (or
   impose) ways to accomplish an activity (not their views or concepts
   like Subjectivists) which they think are the best: "No, do it the
   right way". When speaking of optimality, they speak of optimality in
   general"objective optimality" (they consider that they know the
   "correct", "generally optimal" ways of doing something). In joint
   activities they offer the "most effective" way of doing something. In
   disagreement they do not compare and verify concepts, but instead
   check whether the other person knows the "correct", "generally
   accepted", "established" concepts and terms.
-  In contrast to Subjectivists, Objectivists are not inclined to
   compare and verify concepts. They assume that these can have only one
   unique interpretation ("correct", "accurate" one)often they do not
   think about the fact that the other person may be interpreting them
   differently, within a different conceptual framework. They operate
   with concepts such as "objective reality", "unequivocal facts", and
   do not attempt to verify concepts: "This is called with this term".
   They consider that they know the "right" way of doing things, how
   something "really is" (they acknowledge only a certain picture of the
   world, one that is "objectively true"): "You say it's like this,
   while in reality is like that".
-  In description of actions or in discussion of joint activities
   instead of "explanatory" lexicon they give a lot of examples (all
   "correct" and "incorrect" modes of actions are depicted in these
   examples).

**Notes**

In this research, the hypothesis about the quadra related nature of
entertainment has been show to be untrue. Also proven to be untrue was
the widespread conviction that people of Serious types will not publicly
display and behave in a "childish" manner. Probably in the majority of
such cases (for example when adult people roll themselves down a snow
hill), the situation serves as an intermediary and relaxes the existing
interpersonal boundaries.

**Hypotheses**

Dichotomy Ethics-Logic strengthens one of the attributes of this trait:
Ethics strengthens Subjectivism, while LogicObjectivism.

**Examples**

*Merry/Subjectivists:* "Fun is a lot of emotion... company of friends,
where we can exchange news, possibly go have something to eat, sing a
song" "Fun is getting involved, when you actively participate. When you
watch or read something, this is educational, but fun is an active state
of constant excitement, something one cannot confuse with leisure
(restful state)... perhaps fun for me is an animated dialogue that (as
opposed to a fight, quarrel, etc.) is pleasant" "Reading books, opera -
this is not fun... fun is heightened vitality" "Fun is a state of
liberation when everyone is not being very serious" "Fun is pleasure,
recklessness, everyone participates, some boundaries may get crossed"
"If I'm in a company of new people and nobody introduces me, for me it
is not a problem to introduce myself" "The majority of people with whom
I chat, I may not know their full name" "The process of coming into
contact can consist of any steps, becoming acquainted is not necessary"
"For me, in company, the names of others are not important" "I
remembered what his name was only after a week, even though we had
already passionately kissed (about meeting her future husband)" "When I
see that someone doing something wrong, I first have to check if that is
any of my business. If it concerns me, then my first reaction is to step
back and let him have enough... I have my own criteria for how things
should be. Other people may have their own criteria" "First, put down
the axe, then explain why you are doing that" "I assumed that I have
said all that was relevant to the given theme/topic"

*Serious/Objectivists:* "It is difficult for me to distinguish work
activities apart from fun. Fun is difficult to define ..." "I approach
everything seriously, even rest" "It is always possible to find
something entertaining/zany in the serious, and vice versa" "Studying
should be fun. Work without an entertaining element is impossible" "What
constitutes "fun" to me is not clear, what is leisure - that is clear,
what is entertainment - that is also clear" "It is important that I get
introduced when I'm in company of people I never met before, or better
yet, that they have been told a little about myself" "I engage another
person on conditions that he/she has proposed, I do not engage the
person if I do not know whether the contact will be "pleasant" for
him/her" "I do not like it when other people "thrust" themselves upon me
or when it is done to others, for example, if suddenly my aunt whom I'm
seeing for the first time starts calling me "honey" or use some other
endearing expression" "The name is important. If a person does not state
their name, it often means that they do not want to have a conversation"
"If it is done the wrong way? Oy! It is easier for me to grab it and do
it myself than to waste my time explaining. In my opinion there is only
one way to "hammer a nail"" "There are things with which it is clear
that some methods are futile/fruitless and that there are more effective
ways of doing it. It's very irritating when a person consistently fails
to see this and keeps choosing inappropriate methods" "When I see
something performed ineffectively it makes my stomach churn" "It is
painful for me to see something that contradicts common sense and I can
do nothing about it. If I can interfere with the situation, I will do so
regardless of whether or not it concerns me" "The methods habitual to
the person within the framework of his/her experience are not the same
thing as objective method of doing things (this is evident by the
results)".
