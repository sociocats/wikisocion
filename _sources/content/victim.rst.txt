Victim
================

The **Victim** types, identified as such by :doc:`Viktor Gulenko <gulenko>`, are the four types with Ni |symbol_t.gif| in their
:ref:`ego <ego-block>`, two each in :doc:`Beta <beta_quadra>` and :doc:`Gamma <gamma_quadra>`:
:doc:`EIE <EIE>`, :doc:`IEI <IEI>`, :doc:`LIE <LIE>`, and :doc:`ILI <ILI>`.

Despite the differences between these types in terms of
:doc:`temperament <temperament>`, :ref:`base function <leading-func>`, and
:doc:`quadra <quadra>` :doc:`values <quadra>`, it seems that in the area of
physical attraction, desire, and flirting, the `Ego <Ego>`
:doc:`element <elements>` Ni |symbol_t.gif|, coupled with their
expectations of Se |symbol_f.gif| style behavior in intimate partners,
is the most visible factor in a Victim's behavior.


Typical characteristics of the Victim romance style
---------------------------------------------------

-  prone to initial doubts about intensity of own interest in another
   person
-  not always confident about revealing that interest
-  inclined to focus on whether or not the other person might
   reciprocate the interest
-  inclined to question whether or not the other person's interest will
   remain constant with time
-  preference for partners that provoke in the individual a certain
   sense of awe in terms of power, physical presence, and the like
-  appreciation for the sense of power-play present when interacting
   with such partners, with acceptance of a slight sense of superiority
   on the part of the partner, without ever actually "submitting" to
   them
-  this takes the form of the individual somewhat expecting the partner
   to be "mean" on occasion
-  in the case of Victim males with female partners, this latter trait
   assumes a characteristic analogous to a "knight devoted to his
   princess"
-  inclination to openly admit to a relationship having been ended by
   the partner rather than by the individual himself

This romance style is defined by focus on |symbol_t.gif| which is
dynamic, irrational, and introverted, with perceptions of inner imagery
away from the present physical reality. This means that a Victim sees
attraction between two individuals as a dynamic state, which he feels is
completely natural. This accounts for a Victim's inclination to focus on
the mutual attraction, or particularly the attraction felt by the other
person, as to its longer-term perspectives and implications, as well as
a certain expectation that the partner will continuously take action to
confirm the attraction. Failure on the partner to do so results on the
individual assuming that it's already changing. The individual counts on
the partner to forcefully bring the individual "down to earth from his
thoughts " and focus on the immediate physical reality, continuously.

Perception of other romance styles
----------------------------------

This refers to perceptions of the partner in a romantic or prospective
relationship.

:doc:`Aggressor <aggressor>`\ **:** Victims tend to perceive Aggressors as
pleasantly reassuring, providing direct unequivocal signals to their
interests and intents, given to taking concrete actions and initiatives
to meet their goals. They find Aggressor's conscious realization of
their sexual desires to be attractive and reflecting positively on their
own level of romantic motivation.

:doc:`Victim <victim>`\ **:** Victims tend to perceive other Victims as
puzzling, evasive, even non-committal, not giving them clear signals and
given to playing "waiting" and "push-pull" games that slow down
relationship development, but also as exciting partners if a certain
stage of "certainty" is finally reached. Courting of two Victims types
resemble attempts to make the other adopt Aggressor behavior or to
patiently wait out until the other person does so on their own.

:doc:`Caring <caring>`\ **:** Victims tend to perceive Caring types as a
reassuring, supportive, smooth and stable presence in their life, but
also somewhat dull and monotonous. The excessive attention of Caring
type to Victim's needs and statements is confusing and irritating to the
Victim type. Caring type's inclination to safeguard and protect Victim
types from life's troubles is at first appreciated and viewed as
supportive, but eventually as intrusive and unnecessary.

:doc:`Childlike <childlike>`\ **:** Victims tend to perceive Childlike
types as interesting, refreshing, and captivating in intellectual sense,
but ultimately too focused on mental explorations and idle talk in
absence of any realistic initiatives. In everyday life, Victims may see
Childlike types as too demanding and capricious, expecting too much care
that Victims find exhausting to provide; Victim women are prone to
seeing Childlike men not capable of providing solid support and concrete
initiatives as well as slightly irritating.


Description from :doc:`Life Scenarios <life_scenarios>` by V. Gulenko
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**"Victim"** man (ILI, LIE, EIE, IEI). Idealizes a commanding woman.
Adapts to her tastes, respects volitional qualities in her. In his
behavior at times he emphasizes dependence and obedience, and other
times comes out of control. In relationship with a woman he
subconsciously awaits orders, catches, reprimands. Not receiving these
kinds of reactions, he involuntarily provokes their manifestation.

**"Victim"** woman (ILI, LIE, EIE, IEI). The ideal of this woman is a
physically strong man, reminiscent of lead roles in action movies. She
wishes to experience his force on herself, to resist his pressure, to
feel herself a victim. In love games, she prefers different forms of
opposition and confrontation, that fuel the passions of her partner.
Women of this type sometimes have inherent masochistic traits, though
not all of them consciously acknowledge it.

"Victim" woman cleverly plays on her weakness, vulnerability, or
disorganization, thus provoking "Aggressive" man to undertake prompt
decisive actions. In love games, the greatest value for her are strong
embraces and feeling the power of the male body, yielding to which she
shows her submission to his will. "Caring" men seem comfortable to her,
but too dull partners, while "Childlike" men in her heart she views as
not sufficiently strong and resolute. With similar to her "Victim" men
this woman enters into complex, full of subtext relations, competing
with them in sacrificial attitudes and demanding for it special
privileges. Frequently such games literally wear out and exhaust both of
them.

At this point, I consider it necessary to mention that these
psychoanalytic groups are not being considered in all detail, so some
more subtle differences within them disappear. In particular, among
"Victim" types the fact remains unnoticed that they can further be
divided into the "tragic victims" (IEI and EIE) and "comic victims" (ILI
and LIE).
