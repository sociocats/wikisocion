Eglit, Irina
=====================

Irina Eglit - a Kiev-based socionist associated with `School of System
Socionics <http://en.socionicasys.org/>`__. Self-types as LSE. In Nov
2006, she posted this about herself:

"With socionics I became acquainted 10 years ago. I was typed by one
Dostoevsky (he must have felt his dual :)), and later he became my
husband. Together with him I attended socionics expert courses led by V.
D. Ermak. If I haven't attended those courses, I don't think I would
have stayed on this topic for long. This brought me into Socionics.
Together with students of V. D. Ermak we conducted socionics work in a
secondary school. The results are described in the article Roslankina
Y.V., Eglit I.M., Piatnitski V.V. "From experience on social
rehabilitation of high school students."

Then I again started frequenting socionics websites. At that time, I was
not aware of how much opinions differ in socionics. It seemed to me that
everything is so simple and straightforward: you have a model, you take
it and start typing. I began typing people in Kofeina. It was there that
I was faced with the fact that those who were involved in socionics have
very different understanding not only of the model, but also of the
aspects. Thus arriving at an agreement with other socionists was very
difficult. We were speaking in different languages. Thus an idea came to
create a site where typing would be done in accordance to one theory.
Furthermore, V.D. Ermak always taught us and insisted that typing should
be well reasoned and argumented. He asked us to create a template
protocol for determining types. This is what we have done at the site of
"School of System Socionics". And now we continue activities aimed at
argumentation and proof of validity in typing, and protocols of our
results that everyone could see what is the basis of one or another TIM.
