Architecture
=====================

Socionics may be used to describe and characterize **architecture**.
This approach might be new and subject to dispute, so different
approaches will be discussed here.

An :doc:`images and socionics <images_socionics>` page has been started
at Wikisocion that explores the links between socionics and visual art
(including architecture).

Theory
------

From a :doc:`classical socionics <classic_socionics>` perspective, any
thing, situation, or phenomena contains information
about itself that is perceived differentially by people. Using the
language of :doc:`Aushra Augusta <augusta>`, we might break down
information about an architectural structure roughly as follows:

-  |symbol_i.gif| : the structure's potential and capabilities; the
   central idea or purpose of the structure
-  |symbol_t.gif| : the evolution and lifespan of the structure; a sense
   of meaning or meaninglessness produced by the structure in the viewer
-  |symbol_f.gif| : the structure's shape, form, and appearance; the
   sensory impact of the structure
-  |symbol_s.gif| : the sensations produced by the structure; whether it
   is comfortable or uncomfortable, harmonious or dissonant
-  |symbol_p.gif| : the utility, functionality, and rationale of the
   structure; whether it does its job
-  |symbol_l.gif| : what rules or systems it reflects; what class of
   structure it belongs to
-  |symbol_e.gif| : the expressiveness of the structure; what kinds of
   emotions or state it is projecting
-  |symbol_r.gif| : feelings of like / friendliness or dislike /
   unfriendliness produced by the structure in the viewer

Note that introverted :doc:`information aspects <information_aspect>`
require a certain "internal weighing" of the structure against some
internal parameters, while extraverted aspects focus on the traits of
the structure itself, with little reference to the observer's internal
attitudes.

Clearly, different things may be done with architectural structures to
convey more or less of individual :doc:`information aspects <information_aspect>`. For instance, a building might be
designed to present a simplistic |symbol_f.gif|-impression - with a

bland exterior and as few details as possible that would "catch the eye"
- while conveying plenty of |symbol_p.gif|-impressions, which might

include portals for trucks to drive up and deliver goods, ventilation
tubes, and so forth.



How information aspects are conveyed in architectural structures
----------------------------------------------------------------

Each of the :doc:`information aspects <information_aspect>` (as listed
above) is conveyed through fairly specific construction styles and
decorative elements. Here are some possible means used to convey
information of different kinds:

*Note: these are hypotheses!*

-  |symbol_i.gif| : something novel about the structure that makes you
   try to figure out its intent or purpose or marvel at its uniqueness
   or capabilities
-  |symbol_t.gif| : use of features that suggest a certain age or era of
   the building; use of elements that suggest some kind of unobvious
   symbolism
-  |symbol_f.gif| : bold colors and forms; bold, thick protrusions and
   shapes; solid, stocky, massive forms; oversizing certain parts of the
   structure
-  |symbol_s.gif| : soft, natural, "cozy" colors and forms that generate
   connotations with nature or with a comfortable home or inviting
   habitat
-  |symbol_p.gif| : prominent positioning of unmasked functional
   elements such as doors, input/output ports, moving parts, utility
   mains, etc.
-  |symbol_l.gif| : repetitive identical features (especially geometric)
   and uniformity of style and form that speak of a system behind the
   construction
-  |symbol_e.gif| : use of striking and stimulating, yet non-functional
   embellishments such as a grinning pink crocodile, spikes on the roof,
   etc.
-  |symbol_r.gif| : use of elements of traditional or national culture
   that arouse feelings of affinity and closeness; something endearing
   about the structure
