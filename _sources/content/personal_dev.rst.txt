Personal development
===========================

Many people are interested in applying socionics to **personal development**.

This may mean a combination of things:

* pursuing self-realization (esp. professional) through the :ref:`Ego functions <ego-block>`
* resolving long-term problems in the :ref:`Super-Id functions <superid-block>`
* giving oneself some slack in the :ref:`Super-Ego functions <superego-block>` -- or, for other people, tightening the discipline 

In general, it seems that the goal is to achieve greater spontaneity, confidence, awareness, and to be at peace with one's surroundings.
