Business observations
=============================



SEI-IEI
-------

**Olesia (IEI)**: The differences in communication can be summarized as:
IEI "All these details are irrelevant. What are you trying to say?
What's the main point?" SEI "Here are the specifics. Why don't you care
about them? You're making a load of assumptions!" IEIs and SEIs seems
similar in dealing with day-to-day situations - we have same creative
and activating functions - but their overall, mental maps are very
different. SEIs absorb things as they are with all the specifics, while
IEIs' maps consist of generalized laws and quasi-philosophical
wonderings. This complicates deeper communication that isn't immediately
applicable to the situation at hand, which is likely why these are
called relations of business.

| **Phili (IEI)**: Sometimes I feel like SEIs don't like my type of
  philosophizing. When we talk about topics in literature, art,
  economics, philosophy I find that SEIs are much more specific in how
  they think. They will sprinkle the conversation with names, dates,
  specific references, word-for-word quotes. I keep thinking that all of
  this is extraneous in conversation. I want to hear them put it all
  together and see the meaning behind it, but all I get are these
  strings of very specific information. While they cannot believe how I
  could immerse myself in a subject thoroughly without recalling all
  these bits, and particularly without going to the original sources to
  read it exactly word-for-word. When I don't demonstrate such polished
  in all its detail knowledge, they think I don't know what I'm talking
  about. As least this is how one of my SEI teachers was.
| That we are different in Reinin's Tactical/Strategic also stands out,
  but in a good, complimentary way. Once I planned a trip to go visit a
  museum in another city with a SEI friend. This city had two streets by
  the same name. We ended up on the wrong one - and now we couldn't make
  it on time to the museum! as it was across the city and closing soon.
  My SEI friend became distraught and kept lamenting about how upsetting
  it is that we won't make it, when I suggested that we could just as
  well explore the neighborhood cafes and shops. My suggestion was very
  welcome, she lightened up, and a couple minutes later we were
  strolling down the streets of the neighborhood. She was so fixated on
  the goal of getting to this museum that she didn't realize that we
  could do something else instead, while I, as tactical type, readily
  change the plan to reach some more accessible, nearby goals.
| She will sometimes praise my intuition, while I will marvel at her
  sensing. But because both of our sensing and intuition are introverted
  and "hidden" from each other's view, it's not apparent until each of
  us receives help from the other on this aspect. One time I have
  intuitively found a way for her to solve a problem for her computer
  science class assignment, for which she was very grateful. Another
  time, when I moved to a new place, she came by and pointed out several
  things about the interior of the new place that would have made it
  more comfortable. But she merely point them out - on her next visit
  she brought new drapes for my windows and then helped me hang them.
  She also draw my attention to more practical aspects of life, as well
  as to nuances of appearance and behavior of other people that I don't
  easily notice otherwise. But it also gets too tiring for me after a
  while to pay attention to all these details; soon my mind starts
  drifting away and I start thinking: "What is the main point?"
| My SIE friend is very friendly in casual conversations and
  friendships, but up close she will reveal her negative side. She was
  seeing a SLE for a while, and one time he exclaimed to her: "You can't
  talk so poorly of other people!" I can see how some of her negative
  comments would be helpful for an ILE, with ILE's rosy, impractical,
  and idealistic perception of people, but the SLE sees people's weak
  points himself, and for him SEI's negative comments aren't needed and
  only further aggravating.
| All in all, the IEI and the SEI can have a good friendship and a
  stable union, for as long as you learn to compromise and neither of
  you insists that your base function is the only valid way of seeing
  things.
