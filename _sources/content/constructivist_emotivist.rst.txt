Constructivist and emotivist
=================================

**Constructivist** / **Emotivist** is one of the 15 `Reinin dichotomies <reinin_dich>`.


Constructivist and emotivist types
----------------------------------

-  The constructivist :doc:`IM types <socionic_type>` are: :doc:`ILE <ILE>`,
   :doc:`ESE <ESE>`, :doc:`EIE <EIE>`, :doc:`SLE <SLE>`, :doc:`ILI <ILI>`,
   :doc:`ESI <ESI>`, :doc:`SLI <SLI>`, and :doc:`EII <EII>`.
-  The emotivist :doc:`IM types <socionic_type>` are: :doc:`SEI <SEI>`,
   :doc:`LII <LII>`, :doc:`LSI <LSI>`, :doc:`IEI <IEI>`, :doc:`SEE <SEE>`,
   :doc:`LIE <LIE>`, :doc:`LSE <LSE>`, and :doc:`IEE <IEE>`.
-  Using the four-letter code: constructivists are TP or FJ, emotivists
   are TJ or FP.


Typical characteristics
-----------------------

Constructivist
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Tend to minimize the emotional elements of interaction, preferring to
   focus on the 'business' elements.
#. Have emotional 'anchors' (eg, books, films, places) which they use to
   support their internal emotional state.
#. Can become 'emotionally hooked', and can have a strong reaction to a
   particular part or section regardless of their feelings towards the
   entirety.
#. Have greater difficulty disassociating from others' emotions and
   experiences than from requests for action or consideration.
#. I prefer when people offer concrete solutions instead of comfort or
   sympathy.

Emotivist
~~~~~~~~~

#. Tend to concentrate foremost on the emotional background of
   interaction, with 'business' a secondary concern.
#. Prefer the new and novel over the old and known.
#. Information perceived as unprofessional or low-quality can leave them
   indifferent.
#. Have greater difficulty disassociating from requests for action or
   consideration than from others' emotions and experiences.
#. If a conversation is emotionally negative, I consider it wasted.

Taken from `2003 study of Reinin traits <reinin_study>`.

Constructivists
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  In contact with other people, constructivist types try to reduce or
   completely avoid any stages of emotional contact (to "skip" it). They
   do not consider overall emotional attitude as a necessary element of
   interaction (in interaction, they discuss or do something together,
   not always emotionally "re-adjusting")
-  For the constructivist emotional "anchors" are important (connected
   to a certain place, book, movie, etc.) which resonate with their
   internal emotional condition. With the help of such anchors, they
   hold onto or strengthen their inner emotional state. They are
   inclined to re-reed a book or to visit the same place again just to
   go through the emotions connected with that place.
-  They can get "emotionally hooked", experience strong emotions
   regardless of whether they like the overall quality of material
   presented (for example, they may dislike a movie as a whole but laugh
   or cry during a single scene from it).
-  They disassociate themselves from other's emotions and worries with
   greater difficulty than from requests to do or think over something.

Emotivists
~~~~~~~~~~

-  In interaction with other people, they try to get them into the
   "correct" emotional state (or readjust themselves). In interaction
   they are drawn into the overall emotional orientation (they
   distinguish communication and relating as a separate type of
   activityas "immersion into the atmosphere"). While discussing some
   matter, an emotivist may "wander off" away from the subject and "go
   off" on an emotional exchange.
-  Emotivists would rather prefer new impressions than returning to
   something already lived through, an old experience (even if its
   emotionally pleasant). They will re-read a book or revisit the same
   place in cases they have forgotten something or in hopes of finding
   something new.
-  Information (for example, book, movie, excursion) perceived as
   presented unprofessionally, of "poor quality", does not provoke the
   emotivist emotionally but leaves them indifferent.
-  They distance themselves form requests of others to do or consider
   something with greater difficulty than from emotions and worries of
   others.

**Hypotheses**

Constructivists less critically receive emotions, they get "loaded" by
them. After falling into a particular emotional state, constructivists
stay in it for a prolonged period of time, therefore they try to avoid
information that is unacceptable or unpleasant for them emotionally. For
emotivists calls for action/consideration are not critically evaluated,
thus they can get "loaded" by them and switch to thinking about a
certain topic. After getting into a theme they stay in that mode of
operation for a prolonged period of time and have difficulty switching,
"disconnecting" (due to this they try to avoid unacceptable
requests/topics).

**Examples**

*Constructivists:* "I try to reduce emotional contact. I always start
with a set of automatic responses (give slippers, pour some tea or
coffee...)" "If somebody has come for a shoulder to cry on I generally
know what to do" "It is so much easier to come into contact over some
objective matter (interaction by pertaining to the matter at hand)" "I
prefer when people offer me concrete solutions to my problemsit is
better than consolations" "If I wish to help, then of course by action.
Very rarely I call just to inquire how things are going. I track moods
in parallel" "I listen to music depending on my mood" "I will re-read
the whole book for specific paragraphs... What does it mean "poorly
written"? It stirs methat's what's important" "I drive over to the same
place, it's as if I'm visiting my home" "I try not to see movies that I
know are emotionally heavy. I won't watch them over again most
certainly" "I can worry for people for a long time, even those whom I
casually met" "The first time you watch a comedy is to laughafter that
it's to relive these experiences".

*Emotivist:* "First of all, I attempt to create a comfortable
psychological atmosphere. I try to direct new people into the situation,
"build bridges", help them "accommodate" so that they feel at ease" "I
strike up new contacts with words, not actions" "If emotional atmosphere
of an interaction is negative I consider the conversation "wasted"
(unsuccessful)" "Before a dialogue I as if check the emotional states of
people involved and try to positively orient them" "It's easier to
change the emotional background" "I can talk about various things that I
don't believe in or have no interest in simply "for the spirit" of the
conversation" "I need new experiences so I am likely to visit a new
place. If I return, then I return to a place where "the road has
changed" since I last visited" "I won't watch a movie that was poorly
directed. Poorly written book doesn't stir and involve me" "I'll re-read
a book if I have forgotten the storyline" "If I'm asked to consider/do
something what I'll most remember is the act of request itself".

**Constructivists**

Constructivists try to get into the right mindset for an activity and it
takes time for them to get from one mindset to another. When they are at
home, they are mentally prepared for anything that could happen at home
and when they are at work, they switch over to work-mentality. They can
get overwhelmed by emotions because once they get into an emotional
state, they stay in that emotional state for a long time.
Constructivists avoid emotional contact with others and they don't think
it's necessary to adjust to the conversation emotionally. They use
automatic polite responses and customs, like starting with "how are
you?" or offering their guests coffee or tea. Practical conversation
(talking "business") is easier for them. They like to repeat emotional
states - rereading books, watching movies that they have already seen
and revisiting places they liked. They avoid movies, situations and
people who give them a negative mindset, because they have a difficult
time getting rid of that mindset. Constructivists use emotional anchors
(carefully chosen music, books, movies) to keep or strengthen their
internal emotional state.

**Emotivists**

Emotivists try to enter the emotional atmosphere of the conversation and
they try to keep the emotion in the conversation positive. They can talk
about various things they have no interest in or do not believe in
simply for the sake of maintaining a "positive spirit". Talking business
is more difficult and the conversation topic can wander off into
emotional exchange. They try to get new experiences and new emotions,
which is why they travel to new places and rarely watch movies they have
already seen. In emotivists calls for action/requests are not critically
estimated and because of it they can get overwhelmed by them. After
getting into a theme they stay in that mode of operation for a prolonged
period of time and have difficulty switching, "disconnecting" (and
because of it try to avoid unpleasant requests).

**Examples**

In forum conversations when a person asks a question, emotivists reply
with conversational posts trying to find out what caused such a question
and trying to see if they can make the person feel better. They can also
include an answer to the question, but that's secondary. Constructivists
give as good of an answer as they can to help find a solution. They
might also include a question about why the question was asked by this
particular person, but only when they are curious about it. It's not
important for the thread (conversation) itself.

Constructivists don't mind seeing a movie that they have already seen,
but emotivists would only do that if there might be some new information
that they missed the first time or if they have forgotten a lot about
the movie. Constructivists might prefer re-watching a movie that gave
them a good emotion to seeing something brand new that they don't know
if they'll like. This is because constructivists have inert ethics and
it's difficult to get rid of the wrong emotional state, but emotivists
have contact ethics so they want to experience new emotions.

Theoretical properties of constructivist and emotivist types
------------------------------------------------------------

Constructivist/emotivist corresponds with the
:ref:`inert <contact>`/ :ref:`contact <contact>` dichotomy for
`rational <ration_irration>` `information elements <elements>`:

-  The constructivist types have contact :doc:`logic <ethics_logic>` and inert
   :doc:`ethics <ethics_logic>`.
-  The emotivist types have contact ethics and inert logic.
