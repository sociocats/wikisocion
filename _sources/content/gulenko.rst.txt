Gulenko, Viktor
========================

Biography
---------

Victor Vladimirovich Gulenko (February 12th, 1958) is the founder of the
`School of Humanitarian Socionics <http://socioniks.net/>`__ and a
Ukrainian socionist from Kiev. He is the author of many important
articles on socionics and the second most-cited socionist in papers on
socionics in Russian (after :doc:`Augusta <augusta>`). He is well-liked as
a lucid speaker and regularly holds socionics courses in Kiev and gives
lectures in other cities.

\V. Gulenko's views have diverged from mainstream socionics in recent
years, and he is now viewed as somewhat of a controversial figure. In
talks at annual socionic conferences in Kiev he regularly emphasizes his
school's differences with "classical socionics". V. Gulenko has
introduced a number of new dichotomies to differentiate between people
of the same type. Gulenko's self-typing is :doc:`LII <LII>` (extended
typing: LII-Ne sp/so e5). By personal accounts his wife's type is EIE,
and he has a son and daughter of types LSI and EIE, respectively.

Proposed function designations
------------------------------

Gulenko introduced Latin-based symbols to represent the eight classical
IM elements, or socionic functions. While they have not become popular
on socionics forums, they are often used in publications by socionists
both within and outside of the School of Humanitarian Socionics. In
particular, they allow for easy discussion of functions and Model A
without having to use special graphics. This notation is discussed in
greater detail in the article on :doc:`Type names <type_names>`.
