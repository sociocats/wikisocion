On socionics
------------

"I'm confident that the basic concepts of Socionics are simple enough to
be understood  even in elementary school. However, despite this
simplicity, Socionics has tremendous potential for influencing all of
our social interactions, whether this is by improving mutual
understanding or by raising the level of humanism in society. These are
not just words; we have demonstrated these effects with every group that
has been taught Socionics. Since modern society is built on information,
problems caused by communication and mutual understanding have a
profound effect. Socionics is the best known way of addressing these
issues."

"Socionics may and must become the fact of culture. Its influence is
utterly beneficial in all fields of the human life. Self-identity,
tolerance, constructive way to communicate are direct consequences of
learning socionics. But nothing comes easily. To bring socionics into
daily life, we have to promote and advocate it, create educational
materials, and provide practical examples of its efficiency both in
enterprise and in the personal life. That's what we do on daily basis:
develop educational methods, educate, promote and implement."
