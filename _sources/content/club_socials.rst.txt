pair of :doc:`Gamma <gamma_quadra>`.

**Light socials** are :doc:`ESE <ESE>` and :doc:`SEI <SEI>`. They are a mirror
pair of :doc:`Alpha <alpha_quadra>`.


Group behavior
--------------

When a group consists of members of this club, but without either of the
two quadras having greater weight, its interactions are likely to be
based on enjoying conversations over their families and personal
relationships, artistic and sensorial interests such as cooking, gossip,
and group social activities such as parties, dancing, travels and
sportive activities. It's the stereotypical "women's group", although
obviously such clubs formed only of men also exist, with common
activities and interests usually focused around sports or, depending on
the age structure, partying, clubbing and the like.

This kind of group behavior, though, in terms of seeing a club as any
kind of unit, is visible only as long as the group is held together by,
and focuses on, discussions and activities of their common interests.
Longer and deeper interactions make such a club visibly "split" into the
two quadras, Alpha and Gamma.


Perception of other clubs
-------------------------

These perceptions are visible only as long as the other groups are seen
exclusively through the prism of their activities and interests as a
group; closer interaction makes such perceptions quickly be overruled by
the relevant quadra perceptions.

Researchers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Socials are inclined to regard Researchers with either a sort of pity,
thinking that Researchers "need to get out more and be more friendly",
or admiration for their perceived knowledge in many areas.

Pragmatists
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Socials are inclined to enjoy Pragmatists' company in social activities
and appreciate their practical skills but also to see them as too
abrasive or cold.

Humanitarians
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Socials are inclined to regard Humanitarians as idealistic people but
"dreaming too much" and not very practical.
