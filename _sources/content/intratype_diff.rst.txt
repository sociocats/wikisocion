Intratype differences
==========================

**Intratype differences** refer to significant variation in basic personality, behavior, and/or appearance among people of the same socionic type.

Years of experience studying intratype differences has led many socionists to create subtype systems that structure these differences in some way. However, there are many different approaches to intratype differences. On one end of the spectrum, some socionists ignore them, considering them to be outside the realm of socionics, while on the other end of the spectrum some socionists try to expand socionics to describe as much of personality as possible by developing complex :doc:`subtype <subtype>` systems.
