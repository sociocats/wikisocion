Portrait of a Modern Socionist
===================================

**Portrait of a Modern Socionist** was a study undertaken by :doc:`Dmitriy Lytov <lytov>` among Russian speaking socionists and enthusiasts in
February-March 2007 and published in May. 49 people (24 men and 25
women, average age 31 years) took part by filling out a rather long
questionnaire. All but 3 resided in Russia or Ukraine.

Findings
--------

*Most of the findings (the most informative) have been included in this
section.*

-  63% had known about socionics for at least 3 years (11 people had
   known about it for 3-5 years, 9 from 5 to 10 years, and 11 for more
   than 10 years).
-  59% learned about socionics by studying books and Internet articles
   on their own. Nearly a quarter had studied with well-known
   socionists. 30% of respondents teach or write about socionics.
-  Respondents' types, by dominant pole of dichotomy: extratims - 54%,
   irrationals - 58%, logicals - 61%, and intuiters - 65%. Alpha quadra
   types were most common.
-  47% had been typed by professional socionists, 45% had typed
   themselves, 29% used tests, 18% were typed at training seminars, and
   10% had been typed on socionics forums.
-  41% had changed their opinion of their type at least once.
-  Those who were most sure of their types (i.e. had changed their
   opinion least) had discovered their types at trainings and on forums.
   The other methods mentioned above tended to result in more
   re-typings.
-  41 out of 49 respondents said they diagnosed types.

Participants were asked to express their opinions on various questions
using a 5-point scale, where 5 meant complete trust and 1 meant a
complete lack of trust.

**Reliability of typing methods:**

-  Live interview method: "mostly reliable"
-  Structured question method (when specific questions are asked and the
   answers analyzed): "somewhat reliable"

   "unreliable"

   reliable"
