Model J
==============

Model J (Модель Ю in Russian) is an early socionic model which contains the :doc:`functions <functions>` 1, 2, 4 and 5 of :doc:`Model A <model_a>`. :doc:`Augusta <augusta>` created Model J simply as a visual representation of :doc:`Carl Jung <jung>`'s descriptions of four functions of the psyche. Later, as she developed her theory, she replaced Model J with Model A, which contained all eight :doc:`IM elements <elements>` and provided a fuller picture of the psyche and information interaction between types.

In Model J, for example, an ILE would be: |Ne| |Ti| |Fi| |Se|

Today Model J is used by a small handful of "old school" socionists, most notably :doc:`Ekaterina Filatova <filatova>`.
