Sensing and intuition
===========================

**Sensing** / **Intuition** is one of the 4 jungian dichotomies, and one
of the 15 :doc:`Reinin dichotomies <reinin_dich>`. **Sensing** in
socionics is a perceptual quality defined by a focus on the tangible,
directly sensible, and visible content of reality. In contrast,
**intuition** means a focus on intangible, indirectly perceivable, and
hidden content of reality.

Sensing and intuitive types
---------------------------

Sensing :doc:`IM types <socionic_type>` are: :doc:`SEI <SEI>`, :doc:`ESE <ESE>`,
:doc:`LSI <LSI>`, :doc:`SLE <SLE>`, :doc:`SEE <SEE>`, :doc:`ESI <ESI>`,
:doc:`LSE <LSE>` and :doc:`SLI <SLI>`.

Intuitive :doc:`IM types <socionic_type>` are: :doc:`ILE <ILE>`, :doc:`LII <LII>`,
:doc:`EIE <EIE>`, :doc:`IEI <IEI>`, :doc:`ILI <ILI>`, :doc:`LIE <LIE>`,
:doc:`EII <EII>` and :doc:`IEE <IEE>`.

Using :doc:`four-letter code <type_names>`: Sensing types have an
*S*, intuitive types an *N* as second letter.

Theoretical properties
----------------------

In socionics, two :doc:`IM elements <elements>` are sensing
(|symbol_f.gif| and |symbol_s.gif|), and two are intuitive
(|symbol_i.gif| and |symbol_t.gif|).

:doc:`IM types <socionic_type>` which contain sensing elements either on
:doc:`functions <functions>` 1 and 7, or :doc:`functions <functions>` 2 and 8,
are called **sensing types**. Those which contain intuitive elements one
of those :doc:`function <functions>` pairs are called **intuitive types**.

Description of the functions
----------------------------

Sensing
~~~~~~~

**Sensing** is a mental process (or 'psychic function') that involves
focusing on concrete, tangible details that can be directly experienced.
Sensing comes in two varieties (:doc:`extraverted <extroverted>` and
:doc:`introverted <introverted>`) depending on whether attention is focused
on reality outside the subject or on the subject's impressions of
reality.

Half of the :doc:`socion <socion>` consists of **sensing** types. These
types have either :doc:`introverted <Si>` or
:doc:`extraverted <Se>` sensing in their :ref:`Ego block <ego-block>` (the first two :doc:`functions <functions>`).

Intuition
~~~~~~~~~

**Intuition** is a mental process (or 'psychic function') that involves
distancing perception from concrete, tangible details. Intuition comes
in two varieties (:doc:`extraverted <extroverted>` and
:doc:`introverted <introverted>`) depending on whether attention is focused
on reality outside the subject or on the subject's impressions of
reality.

Half of the :doc:`socion <socion>` consists of **intuitive** types. These
types have either :doc:`introverted <Ni>`
(|symbol_t.gif|) or :doc:`extraverted <Ne>`
(|symbol_i.gif|) intuition in their :ref:`Ego block <ego-block>` (the first two
:doc:`functions <functions>`).

Typical characteristics of the types
------------------------------------

Sensing types
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. More realistic and down-to-earth.
#. Rather notice details than the big picture.
#. More focused on their surroundings, living in the here and now.
#. More naturally comfortable with physical confrontations.
#. Often more interested in practice than in theory.

Intuitive types
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. More idealistic and head-in-clouds.
#. Rather see the big picture than the details.
#. More focused on ideas than on surroundings.
#. Less naturally comfortable with physical confrontations.
#. Often more interested in theory than in practice.
