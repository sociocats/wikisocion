EJ temperament
=========================

The **EJ temperament**, or **linear-assertive temperament**, was
identified by :doc:`Viktor Gulenko <gulenko>` and includes the four
:doc:`rational <ration_irration>` :doc:`extroverts <extra_intro>` (one in each
:doc:`quadra <quadra>`): :doc:`ESE <ESE>`, :doc:`EIE <EIE>`, :doc:`LIE <LIE>`, and
:doc:`LSE <LSE>`. Each of these types is also :doc:`dynamic <statics_dynamics>`.

Typical characteristics
-----------------------

-  proactive
-  restless
-  difficult to relax unless tired
-  walk tends to be quick-paced and "purposeful", as well as stiff
-  "calmly energetic" with few intense variations in the level of energy
   during the day
-  inclined to fidget when forced to remain inactive for long periods

EJs are both dynamic and rational, so they see reality as in continuous,
gradual, often imperceptible change. At the same time, an EJ has his own
views of what reality "should" be. This inclines him to be quick to take
action, normally using his :ref:`leading function <leading-func>`, in
order to make sure things will remain, or become, as they should be,
before change can get too far.

As extroverts, EJs tend to feel that it is up to them to initiate
contacts with other people, whether in the context of establishing or
maintaining a relationship. They will not necessarily act on that,
though, and sometimes wish others would take over this role.

Perception of other temperaments
--------------------------------

**EP**: EJs see EPs as unpredictable and moody, and therefore a bit
irritating, but also as extremely energetic once they do focus on doing
something, as well as the source of initiatives that may be worthwhile.

**IP**: EJs see IP as unpredictable, moody, as well as too passive and
unreliable, especially if they are required to show initiative or even
reciprocity.

**IJ**: EJs see IJs as solid, reliable, and reassuringly predictable,
and usually not inclined towards being the first to take the initiative
in taking action.
