Vocabulary
=================

This project was inspired by the book :doc:`The Semantics of the Information Aspects <semantic_aspects>`, which attempted
to concreticize the way different :doc:`IM elements <elements>` manifest
themselves in people's speech. Here we are looking for real-life phrases
that reflect the point of view of different IM elements (or 'psychic
functions'). An equivalent project has been started on the `Russian
version of
Wikisocion <http://wikisocion.org/~wikisoci/ru/index.php?title=%D0%A1%D0%BB%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B0%D1%80%D1%8C_%D0%B8%D0%BD%D1%84%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%BC%D0%B0%D1%86%D0%B8%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%BD%D1%8B%D1%85_%D0%B0%D1%81%D0%BF%D0%B5%D0%BA%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%B2#.5B.5B.D0.AD.D0.BA.D1.81.D1.82.D1.80.D0.B0.D0.B2.D0.B5.D1.80.D1.82.D0.BD.D0.B0.D1.8F_.D0.B8.D0.BD.D1.82.D1.83.D0.B8.D1.86.D0.B8.D1.8F.5D.5D_.28.5B.5BImage:symbol_i.gif.5D.5D.29>`__.

Surrealism and symbolism. Use of imagery to represent events and
concepts, painting things in such a way that they seem grander than they
really are. Because |symbol_t.gif| types naturally look beyond what
happens on the surface to the underlying bigger picture, some may
complain about the omission of details (when, where, who, what) or of
mysticism. Except |symbol_t.gif| types have enough difficulty putting
their thought processes into words, much less converting what they see
into details that may reflect corporal reality, but mean nothing. So
those who don't value |symbol_t.gif| may either fail to follow or
respond with criticism, or both.

More importantly, the imagery is not static, but evolving due to their
progressive thought process. When you listen to someone explain
something in |symbol_t.gif|, it is like watching a video. One sees
easily sees how one thing leads to another (if-this-then-that), as well
as the interaction between symbols.
