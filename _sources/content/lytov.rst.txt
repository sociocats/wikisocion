| "Although Marianna and I use the same forum alias, she is rarely on
  the forum; I hope that one day she will write more about herself on
  the forum, for now I will provide a link to her work:
  www.socioniko.net/ru/authors/ marianna.html
| I will speak a little about myself. Lytov Dmitry Alexandrovich, was
  first introduced to Socionics in 1989 through reading articles in
  magazine and newspaper publications. Determined my type by means of
  logical comparison of descriptions, since I got acquainted with tests
  and theory only later. In 1990s, I was a rather passive participant in
  Socionics - frequently attended meetings at the Kiev during my visits
  from St. Petersburgh (reinin adherents somehow did not inspire me, so
  I just talked with the people at Kiev), sometimes delivered my own
  reports at these meetings, but it was mostly Victor Gulenko who used
  these meetings to develop his ideas, and who was also my first teacher
  of socionics. Since 1999, when we finally got permanent Internet at
  work, I became interested in American typologists, participated in
  long correspondence with them and discussions on their forums, then I
  met many interesting people at "Socionics Orgies" (nickname given to
  `socionics.org
  forums <http://www.socionics.org/forums/default.aspx>`__). I am
  especially grateful to Filatova - she introduced me to my future wife,
  though she referred to my non-dual choice with some skepticism.
| It was my acquaintance with Marianna that inspired me to conduct a
  series of studies and research that to that point has been ripening at
  idea stage, waiting for their moment. The first work was an experiment
  for recognizing sociotypes in American descriptions (conducted in Fall
  of 2001). This experiment was done together with Mikhail Morozov and
  Marianna. The following works were criticism of Reinin traits (drafted
  together with Marianna in 2002), creation of multivariate test (in
  2003 and beyond), commentary on type descriptions by Igor Weisband
  (2003-2004), the study of handwriting (ongoing). Full list of
  publications is located here:

  www.socioniko.net/ru/authors/dmitri.html]
| I also have an interest in foreign languages, psycholinguistics (e.g.
  development of human speech, learning several languages, etc.),
  ethology (evolution of animal instincts and human behavior), history,
  political science, and many others.
| In addition, in order to promote Socionics I have created and
  developed a multilingual website www.socioniko.net, as well "Socionics
  newspaper" that eventually turned into a newsletter. On the site, of
  particular interest I consider to be a recently created thematic
  index, which I hope will eventually grow into a kind of encyclopedia
  of Socionics, of its real and hypothetical achievements. And, as the
  inexorable law of the conservation of energy points out, if something
  is added to one place, then something is subtracted from another. Here
  I take this opportunity to refute the myths that circulate about me
  among socionists (mostly likely due to my activity and a large number
  of publications): maybe I'm doing a lot, but I'm not omnipotent and
  don't have a hundred hands. I am not associated with business or
  commerce, and do not plan on venturing there. I am first of all a
  mediocre organizer, and finally, a critic of Reinin traits - which was
  done primarily on merit and incentive of Marianna, and then mine; and
  then there is the multivariate test which is 90% her creation - I
  worked primarily on its promotion. In general, much of my work and
  merits in socionics I owe to those with whom I have collaborated -
  jointly authored articles, conducted experiments, set up the website,
  etc. If from all these collaborations my share is distinguished - it
  will be very small."
