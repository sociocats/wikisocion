IJ temperament
=======================

The **IJ temperament**, or **balanced-stable temperament**, was
identified by :doc:`Viktor Gulenko <gulenko>` and includes the four
:doc:`rational <ration_irration>` :doc:`introverts <extra_intro>` (one in each
:doc:`quadra <quadra>`): :doc:`LII <LII>`, :doc:`LSI <LSI>`, :doc:`ESI <ESI>`, and
:doc:`EII <EII>`. Each of these types is also :doc:`static <statics_dynamics>`.

Typical characteristics
-----------------------

-  calm, balanced and inert
-  "unflappable"
-  rigid but not very fast gait
-  may appear passive-aggressive
-  usually very stable mood
-  more reactive than active
-  little inclination to fidget during long periods of inactivity

IJs are both static and rational, so they see reality as mostly not
changing and when it does, it's in abrupt "leaps" from one state to
another. An IJ draws inner stability from a stable reality, especially
as seen through his :ref:`leading function <leading-func>`. That makes
him confident that things will probably remain as they are despite what
he sees as minor disturbances; periods of clear upheaval are very
disturbing and the individual is anxious that things will "settle down"
one way or the other soon enough.

As introverts, IJs tend to be calm and relaxed about initiating
relationships with other people, mostly assuming that others will take
the initiative, but will be more inclined to try to make sure a
relationship is maintained once established.

Perception of other temperaments
--------------------------------

**EP**: IJs see EPs as unreliable, and too unpredictable in their
impulses and initiatives.

**EJ**: IJs see EJs as pleasantly energetic and willing to take the
initiative and get things going in a balanced, constant way.

**IP**: IJs see IPs as unreliable and unwilling to take any initiative,
with too low levels of energy.
